            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving the Honor of Conſanguinity to ſome of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> and free acceſs to moſt of the Reſt who make up the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that Noble <hi>Judicature,</hi> I thought it not convenient (as well to prevent exceptions as diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions) to dedicate this to any one of their particular Lordſhips, well knowing that to offer any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Univerſal <hi>Intuitions</hi> had been needleſs.</p>
            <p>But I devote it in General to ſuch whoſe Youth, or diverſions (by other Imployments) have
<pb facs="tcp:65438:3"/>made them unknowing, or leſs knowing in this Subject, which I have brancht out into 16 parts, whereof 12 conſiſt of <hi>Precognita</hi> or things fit to be known or done after Summons and before the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any <hi>Parliament,</hi> the 13.14. and 15. are of matters to be known or done only during the ſitting of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>16th.</hi> hath a relation, and is a Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch matters as could not well be Inſerted to the foregoing 15 Parts.</p>
            <p>Tis true, this ſubject of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> hath been treated on by many Learned writers, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none of them have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch a due <hi>Series</hi> as they might have done (for they were more for the <hi>Modus tenendi,</hi> than <hi>Inchoandi</hi>) I have partly from them, and partly from my own obſervations (having been a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="tcp:65438:3"/>12 years, and thereby had intercourſe with the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi>) and partly by the help of ſome worthy Friends) digeſted this Conſtitution into as clear a Method as my leſſer abilities could perform.</p>
            <p>Firſt I ſhew the Gradations and Progreſſes to a <hi>Parliament,</hi> from the Fountain. <hi>viz.</hi> the Kings War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering him to Summon it in Generals by <hi>Writs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next I ſhew his Lordſhips Warrant to the Clerks of the <hi>Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibag,</hi> for framing (according to former Precedents) Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Particulars.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhew that theſe Clerks did Anciently and do ſtill uſe a Method therein, which Method (being fairly ingroſt on one large <hi>Parchment</hi>) is called a <hi>Parliament Pawn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doe not find that any writers
<pb facs="tcp:65438:4"/>before me have made any mention of theſe <hi>Pawns</hi> (nor doe I put any weight on them, but in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod whereby they are compos'd) becauſe I find that the Clerks not conferring with the <hi>Heraulds</hi> have committed many miſtakes in Chriſtian and Surnames, in Titles and Orthography.</p>
            <p>However the Method therein hath continued for many Ages, as will be ſhewn, and though I have tried many ways to frame this Treatiſe, yet none pleaſed me ſo well as the Method uſed in the framing of a <hi>Pawn,</hi> which I have herein purſued.</p>
            <p>The Writs which are contain'd and Methodiz'd in all <hi>Pawns</hi> have two Appellations <hi>viz. Exemplars</hi> and <hi>Conſimilars,</hi> and from thoſe do ariſe the Method of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. But as the <hi>Pawn</hi> doth only recite one Writ of one ſort, (as an Example for <hi>Conſimilar Writs</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:65438:4"/>the ſame ſort to be iſſued, yet are not therein mentioned;) So I by that Method do take occaſion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Treat of the <hi>Exemplars</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in ſome few places (for to Treat of all the <hi>Conſimilars</hi> had been too great a task) by which means I have here only five Writs, which gives me opportunity to treat of the <hi>Blood Royal,</hi> of the <hi>Lords Spiritual,</hi> of the State Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, of the <hi>Lords Temporal,</hi> and of the moſt Eminent <hi>Togati</hi> as the Aſſiſtants in that noble <hi>Houſe,</hi> the other ſeven concerning the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> I ſhall treat of in a diſtinct Part.</p>
            <p>And though my deſign is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to treat of what concerns that noble <hi>Houſe</hi> in this part, yet I could not avoid the Intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſome neceſſary hints of what properly concerns the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> which I intend <hi>(af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vente Deo)</hi> to publiſh by it ſelf.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65438:5"/>
            <p>It was ſcarce poſſible that a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which ſpreads it ſelf into ſuch varieties, ſhould be ſo collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as not to have Omiſſions, ſome of which were purpoſely done, Firſt, that I might not injure the Reader nor my Method by two long diverſions, and yet ſatisfy him in concluſion. <hi>2ly.</hi> I have been as careful as I could to prevent miſtakes, but ſome will be, yet thoſe which are neceſſary to be corrected (<hi>viz.</hi> my own over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights, or the Printers) I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to the end of this Epiſtle, but as for the Printers Omiſſions of Marginal Authorities, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions of Sections, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations (which were in my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py) and for his not putting ſome words into <hi>Italick</hi> Letters, and for want of <hi>Comma's, Points &amp;c.</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Reader, may Eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them.</p>
            <p>I have ſo order'd this Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb facs="tcp:65438:5"/>that you have a Syſtem or the Contents of an Introduction and of 20 ſubſequent <hi>Chapters, Sections</hi> and Obſervations which I thought fit to exhibit, that thoſe who have not the Leiſure to read all the <hi>Chapters,</hi> may turn to ſuch parts as moſt ſuit with their Genius.</p>
            <p>I begin the proper matter of this Treatiſe with the Kings War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1660/1 for Summoning that <hi>Parliament,</hi> and I ſhall End all with His <hi>Proclamation</hi> for its Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in 1678/9.</p>
            <p>In theſe diſcourſes I take the liberty to look back into former Ages, but not forward beyond the Diſſolution of that <hi>Parliament;</hi> Only as an <hi>Appendix,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak of ſome things that are to be done with <hi>Records, Leidger Books</hi> &amp;c. and Allowances to <hi>Knights, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> after any one <hi>Parliament</hi> is ended.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond Eſtate</hi> (and ſo mention'd in our <hi>Laws</hi>) is the <hi>Lords Temporal,</hi> or rather <hi>Militial,</hi> having the <hi>Lieutenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of all the <hi>Counties</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> comitted to their Truſt, Care, and Charge; and to theſe belong the managing of <hi>Embaſſies, Treaties</hi> of <hi>War</hi> or <hi>Peace,</hi> and all honorary Actions, both <hi>Foreign</hi> and <hi>Domeſtick,</hi> as the <hi>King</hi> (who is the Fountain of <hi>Honour</hi>) does uſually confer upon them.</p>

            <p n="2">2.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> All the Exemplar Writs are dated the 18th of <hi>Feb.</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. but there being ſeveral Creations of Lords (or at leaſt their Patents not perfect) after the 18th, all the ſubſequent Writs for ſuch Lords were dated the 29th of <hi>April</hi> following, and that is the reaſon of the different Dates of Writs in the <hi>Pawn,</hi> but all were before the Parliament ſat.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The firſt Exemplars in this <hi>Pawn</hi> for the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> do begin with the words, CAROLUS <hi>Secundus Dei Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Angliae Scotiae Franciae &amp; Hiberniae Rex Fidei Defenſor.</hi> And ſo the firſt Exemplar in the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> Fig. 6. begins in the like words; yet all the other Exemplars in the <hi>Pawn</hi> do begin only with the word <hi>Rex,</hi> omitting the other words, which muſt be underſtood that the ſingle word <hi>Rex, &amp;c.</hi> is ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred only for brevity, not that the Form of the other Examplar or Conſimilar Writs are ſo conciſe, either in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble or body of the Writs (for the ſame reaſon.)</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> In reſpect I do make uſe of the words Exemplar Writs, and Conſimilar Writs,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65438:45"/>it is fit I ſhould ſpeak of the Nature of Writs in general.</p>
                  <p>The Common and Civil Law calls a Wrít in <hi>Latin, Breve, quia brevibus &amp; paucis verbis intentionem Legis exponit.</hi> And of theſe in the Common Law ſome are call'd Original, and others Judicial; the Original (if I do not miſcount them, from the Regiſter of Writs) are 727 in Number: and theſe are us'd in the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Courts in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> before any appearance had, or other Proceſs iſſued in all matters both real and perſonal, and are always in the King's Name, atteſted by the Chief Juſtice of the Court from whence they iſſue; the other, call'd Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Writs,) if I miſcount not the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them from the ſame Regiſter) are 371, which are ſent out by order of thoſe Courts where the original Writ is recorded, and the Caſe depending; and theſe latter do alſo iſſue in the King's Name, and atteſted by the chief Juſtice of the reſpective Courts from whence they proceed, and ſeal'd with green Wax, with the Seals of the reſpective Courts.</p>
                  <p>But the Parliament Writs (of which I am to treat) are of another nature and quality, iſſued only by the King's imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Command and Warrant, and ſeal'd with the great Seal of <hi>England;</hi> and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65438:46"/>theſe have two appellations, <hi>viz. Brevia Clauſa,</hi> (or <hi>operta,</hi>) and <hi>Brevia Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> (or <hi>Aperta.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Brevia Clauſa</hi> are Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons clos'd up in yellow Wax, and ſo ſeal'd with the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and then (as will be more fully ſhewn, after I have diſcours'd diſtinctly of the Writs) ſent (with <hi>Labells</hi>) to every individual Prince of the Blood, Lords Spiritual, Lords Temporal, and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and to every Sheriff of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for Elections of Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes for the <hi>Commons Houſe;</hi> and ſo do concern both <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> and <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> (as alſo the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation Houſes,</hi> dirivatively from the Arch-Biſhops, and Biſhops Writs,) of which laſt I ſhall ſpeak more diſtinctly in this Treatiſe, concerning the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Houſe.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Brevia Patentia</hi> do chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the <hi>Houſe of Lords, viz.</hi> by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of <hi>Creations,</hi> (as alſo ſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as will be ſhewn) and all theſe are call'd <hi>Patentia,</hi> or <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not inclos'd, but open, with the Impreſſion of the great Seal of <hi>England</hi> at large hanging to them, yet all the Created Patentees have their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Writs of Summons, but not the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65438:46"/>Official Patentees, <hi>viz. Clerk of the Crown, Clerk of the Parliament, Clerk to the Houſe of Commons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Patent Writs have no other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation than Literal, or Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, as I ſaid. But the Parliamentary cloſe Writs are divided into two Titles, <hi>viz.</hi> Exemplars and Conſimilars, and though the word Exemplar is not us'd in the <hi>Pawns,</hi> yet the word Conſimile is conſtantly us'd there, which doth imply an Exemplar. The Exemplars are Writs ſet down at large in the <hi>Pawns,</hi> and the Conſimilars are Writs not inſerted in the <hi>Pawns,</hi> and yet are to have a conſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude with their Exemplars, the Exemplar being ſo made upon ſome extraordinary reaſon, as will be ſhewn hereafter.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> As for thoſe Writs which concern the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> (of which I only treat in this firſt Part) as they are more in number than any of the other <hi>Houſes,</hi> (not including derivative Writs, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, or Citations) ſo they are of a more nice nature, in reſpect (as I ſaid) they are perſonal; for a diſtinct Writ is to be provided for every individual Lord ſitting in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> but not ſo in the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> or <hi>lower Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> (as will be ſhewn) and though the main body of the Writs in thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65438:47"/>the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> do differ but little from the Writs of former Kings, or from thoſe of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> yet the Titles do very much vary in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Parliament, partly by the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Barons, partly in their Aſcenſion from Barons to higher degrees, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſplitting of Titles upon extinction of Families, and for other cauſes they are in few years ſubject to variation in Titles, wherein every Lord is exact in having his due, and therefore ſome of the Heralds, (as I ſaid, according to the ſeveral diſtricts of the Kingdom under their managements) are, or ought to be conſulted with, that the Clerks may commit no miſtakes either in their Titles of Grace and Favour, or in their Titles of Rights and Conceſſions, before the Writs be ſealed, and the not effectual doing this (which ought to be done) might occaſion ſome miſtakes and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between the Exemplar and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milary Writs in point of Titles, (as will be ſhewn.)</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> The other parts of the Writs, as well in Exemplars as Conſimilars (which concern not the Titles of the Peers) are the ſame both in the declaratory and mandatory parts, except ſome few words, (of which I ſhall take notice in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65438:47"/>and herein I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with ſhewing what reaſons were given in ſome Writs for ſummoning a Parliament, or what in others, or the reaſon of thoſe Reaſons, and why in ſome there were no Reaſons given, only a ſhort <hi>Mandamus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> All Writs at large recited in this and all former <hi>Pawns,</hi> are the Exemplars of all other Writs of Summons for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament which are not in the reſpective <hi>Pawns,</hi> whereby theſe in this <hi>Pawn</hi> (with the addition of the Biſhops Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar Writs, (which are entred in all former <hi>Pawns</hi>) did and do now make 12 Exemplars, but the Writs which are not recited in this and former <hi>Pawns</hi> (which I term <hi>Conſimilars</hi>) at the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this Parliament, were in all 262.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> Some of the 12 are Exemplars, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writs have a conſimilitude to them, yet have no poſitive Conſimilars ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them, whereof there are but three, <hi>viz.</hi> One to the Lord Chancellor in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> and to the two Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines in the <hi>Commons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> All Writs of Summons to the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> both Exemplars and Conſimilars are Perſonal and Local, but all Writs of Summons for the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> are only Local.</p>

(all which I have recited at large) we may clearly ſee that the word <hi>Council,</hi> doth conſiſt of the Perſons of the beſt Quality and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, to give Counſel and Advice to the King. And when ſuch a number as the King thinks fit to ſelect for that purpoſe do meet in a Body Conjunctively,</p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:65438:56"/>
                  <p n="2">2. This Council is called the <hi>Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> and alſo the Perſons therein are called the <hi>Kings Council,</hi> (yet more properly Counſellors) and to confirm this, the Kings Warrant ſaith: <hi>To Our Right Truſty and well beloved Counſellor Sir</hi> Edward Hyde <hi>Knight Chancellor of</hi> England, (here 'tis Perſonal) then follows, <hi>Whereas We by Our Council,</hi> this intimates a Body of Perſons or Counſellors Congregated.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Writs in the <hi>Pawns</hi> ſometimes do add to the Perſon to whom the Writ is ſent <hi>(Conciliario ſuo)</hi> and ſometimes not, but theſe following words are conſtantly in every Writ, (<hi>Quia de advizamento &amp; aſſenſu Concilij noſtri,</hi> which is more large than what is in the Kings Warrant by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the words <hi>(Advice and Conſent) of Our Council.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſaid Act ſaith in the Preamble, <hi>Foraſmuch as in all great Councils and Congregations of men</hi> (which explains Councils) <hi>and then, that there may be no diſpleaſure or let of the Council) (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Precedency) therefore (for the better reputation of his Counſellors and other Subjects, doth Enact,</hi> &amp;c. And in the <hi>3d.</hi> Paragraph, the Preſident of the Kings Council is there alſo named, by which we underſtand the Kings Privy-Council (of which he is Preſident) to be a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65438:56"/>diſtinct from other Councils where there are Preſidents; <hi>2ly.</hi> And from Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments (where there are Speakers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Preſidents) anciently called the Great Council, and ſo it is ſtill, though the name is alter'd to Parliament) and <hi>3ly.</hi> From other Aſſemblies and Conferences of Councils, (which are the words in the laſt Paragraph of that Act.)</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And therefore this Council here meant in this <hi>Warrant, Pawn,</hi> and <hi>Act,</hi> is that which we now call the Kings Privy Council. Tis true the King hath ſeveral other Councils, (as that of <hi>Wales,</hi> and in the North, and others both here and in Foraign Plantations) but this <hi>Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> is the Supream ſtanding Council, out of which ſometimes the King thinks fit to ſelect ſome few for the more ſafe, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and eaſie diſpatch of Affairs.)</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Which by the <hi>Jews</hi> were called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala,</hi> but by us properly Comitties. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this <hi>Privy Council</hi> is the ſtanding Council of the Kingdom, giving Forms and Being to all other Councils, eſpecially what concerns the Beginning, Continuing, and Ending of any Parliament, and yet this <hi>Council</hi> or <hi>Parliament</hi> is a greater Council than that, and of greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity when it is in being, and therefore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, as I ſaid, call'd <hi>Magnum &amp; Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65438:57"/>Concilium,</hi> and this <hi>Privatum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. This Great and publick Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of the King, Lords Spiritual, Lords Temporal, (<hi>viz.</hi> of ſuch to whom the King ſends Writs of Summons) and of Commons (<hi>viz.</hi> of ſuch as the People think fit to Elect by vertue of the Kings Writs.) But this <hi>Privatum</hi> or <hi>Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> are of ſuch only as the King Elects out of the Degrees next mentioned, or out of other Degrees, as he ſhall beſt judge of their Abilities for it. Yet very often Parliaments have perſuaded Kings to make Alterations in <hi>Privy Councils,</hi> both as to Perſons and Number.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The number of the Perſons of this <hi>Privy Council</hi> are in a manner indefinite, becauſe it depends upon the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But anciently it conſiſted only of 12. ſince that they have increaſed and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and in the beginning of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were 29. but before the end of it above 40. The number of the <hi>Great Council</hi> or <hi>Parliament</hi> is partly indefinite, (in the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi>) and partly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, (and ſo in the <hi>Commons Houſe</hi> (as will be ſhewn,) for theſe anciently had not above 2. or 300. but this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had in both Houſes above 700. (as will be ſhewn.)</p>

                  <p n="9">9. This very name of <hi>Council</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,</hi> (as they are or ought to be) is much more ancient than the <hi>Conſuls</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which had their name <hi>a Conſulendo,</hi> for their abilities in giving Counſel, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly borrow'd from the name of <hi>Neptune</hi> the God of the Sea, who was call'd alſo <hi>Conſiliorum Deus,</hi> ſo as probably of their two yearly Conſuls, one was choſen for the Affairs of the Sea, (as Admiral) the other for the Affairs of the Land, as Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, however it is obſervable that the Title of <hi>Conſul</hi> or <hi>Counſellor</hi> did continue 1046. years in that Empire, deducting three years interpoſition of the <hi>Decemviri</hi> (or 10 Governors,) and 4 years of <hi>Tribunes</hi> (or 3 Governors,) and 12 years of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi> conſiſting of 4 Governors, and 30 years by <hi>Tribunes</hi> conſiſting of ſix Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and 5 years under an <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and 2 years wherein <hi>Tribunes</hi> had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulary power, and then the Government again ſlid into <hi>Conſuls,</hi> ſo as deducting theſe 56 years, they continued intire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Conſulary Tutelage</hi> 990 years: and as that way of Government was uſeful to <hi>Rome</hi> whilſt it was a Common-wealth, ſo we ſee when <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> took on him the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and turn'd it to a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, he did not diſcard the Conſula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way of managing Affairs, nor did his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65438:58"/>Succeſſors; ſo as they continued full 540. years after <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in proſecution of that Monarchical Empire, till the Papal Intereſts had ſupplanted the Weſtern Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and made General Councils, tending rather to the diſ-uniting of Princes, than for uniting Religion, as was pretended, and inſtead of Conſuls, erected a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory and Conclave, the laſt being only new names for a Council.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. This is certain, that Councils or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors or Conſuls are of that nature, that no Government can ſubſiſt without them, though by different Appellations; and I read of few or none in all the <hi>Roman</hi> Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who had the Title of Conſul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd on him, but thoſe who either by their Wiſdom had given ſuch good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel as prov'd proſperous to the Empire, or had done ſuch eminent Services, that from ſuch Heroick actions the Emperors and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators derived Arguments of their Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to Counſel, as having actually done, and from that experience might Counſel what was fit to be done, and thereupon formerly call'd Conſul, and now Counſel or Counſellor, and fit to ſit both in <hi>Privy Council</hi> or <hi>publick Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. This Honour was ſtill founded in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; by the eſtimation of Judgment, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Reſolution; for what they had
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65438:58"/>Adviſed, Counſell'd, or Succeſsfully acted, and therefore they were ſeldom made <hi>Viri Conſulares</hi> till they were 43. years of age, and for ſuch as had been thus Serviceable to the Empire, if a Conſulſhip were not void, yet they had always ſome Offices or Rewards in ſtore which they conferr'd proportionably to their Services; and ſuch Rewards were purpoſely reſerv'd for ſuch as had either given good Counſel, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, by venturing their Lives and Fortunes for preſervation of the Empire, and ſome ſuch Orders were made in our <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>3ds.</hi> time, and confirmed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Succeſſive Councils, as may be read in Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> and Judge <hi>Dodridge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. There are alſo other leſſer Councils, (beſides what I mentioned before) as the Common Council of <hi>London,</hi> (and the like though not for number in other Cities) (which relate only to the Government of thoſe Cities and Counſellors at Law, and the meeting (of ſuch degrees as are qualified for that purpoſe) are called in ſome of the Inns of Court, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which relate only to matters of Law and Government of their Societies, and Councils of War and Trade, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe are great Aſſiſtants and often imploy'd both in the Privy and publick Council of the Kingdom.</p>

                  <p n="13">13. I have been the longer on this ſubject becauſe all the Degrees hereafter mentioned are Members either of the Kings <hi>Privy Council</hi> or the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or both, yet their Writs of Summons are not ſingly <hi>Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> but by annexation to thoſe Degrees which are capacitated to be Counſellors, but the Degrees mentioned in the Act (of whom I treat next) are conſtantly of the <hi>Privy Council</hi> or <hi>Parliament;</hi> but there are only ſome of the <hi>Parliament</hi> which are of the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> by which means matters are more eaſily manag'd between the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the one conſtantly Sitting, the other Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd only upon Emergencies of State, which latter being thus Conſtituted, it may well be call'd <hi>Magnum Concilium Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum,</hi> or a Council of Souls rather than Bodies, ſo as the King may ſay with <hi>Cicero, Conſcientia conciliorum meorum me Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latur, i. e.</hi> The knowledge and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious concurrence of minds or Souls, (for ſo <hi>Conſcientia</hi> ſometimes ſiguifies) <hi>and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of my Counſellors are my Conſolation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. In the firſt Chapter I have ſhewn the Liſt of the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> who gave their Advice (as tis ſaid in the Warrant) for Summoning the Parliament to begin the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1661. and all but one of them had Summons, and did ſit in the

                     </label> IN <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time, and long after, this Office was call'd Keeper of the Privy or Private Seal, diſtinguiſhing him from the other, call'd the Keeper of the Great Seal; afterward he was call'd Clerk of the Privy-Seal, (Clerk being then a Title of Eminency) and <hi>Gardien del Privy-Seal,</hi> and in 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Lord Privy-Seal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath his Office by Patent, but the Keeper of the Great Seal (as I ſaid) only by delivery of that Seal, and 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that this Office was in imitation of that which was us'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Officer whereof was call'd <hi>Comes privato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and as <hi>Caſſiodore</hi> calls him, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the King's private Affairs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whilſt the <hi>Court of Requeſts</hi> was in uſe he was alſo call'd the Maſter of it, being Maſter or Superiour to the Four Maſters of <hi>Requeſts,</hi> who were to receive, peruſe, and preſent all Petitions to the King, or to the Parliament in time of Parliament, and direct the Petitioners in the right way of proceeding in their buſineſs, and for want of this direction many men are ruin'd
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65438:64"/>by crafty and unskilful directors, and the Parliament troubled with needleſs appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; for I conceive this Court was plac'd (as will be ſhewn) between the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> and <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> for the Maſters to ſit there in time of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as Tryers of Petitions to either Houſe, and were to judge, whether the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was proper for either Houſe, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Court, which doubtleſs did take off a great expence of time from both Houſes, and from intangling them in matters which were properly relievable in other places.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There are three forts of Seals which are chiefly us'd for publick Affairs; two of them paſs under the names of Privy or Private, the other, the Great or Broad-Seal: yet for a clearer diſtinction, one of the two is call'd the Privy Signet, and hath four Clerks to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend its Office, the other the Privy-Seal and hath alſo four Clerks to attend its Office; and the third is call'd, (as I ſaid) the Great Seal, and hath properly ſix Clerks to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, but increas'd to many more. The Privy Signet is under the Cuſtody of the Chief Secretary of State; the Privy Seal, under the Cuſtody of the Lord Privy Seal; and the Broad Seal under the Cuſtody of the Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper, ſo as moſt matters which concern a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King's pleaſure in writing, do
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65438:65"/>take their riſe from the Privy Signet, and from thence tranſmitted to the Privy Seal, and from thence to the Great Seal, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its determination.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But to paſs by all private or publick Matters about which theſe three Officers are concern'd, this is certain, that the Clerks of theſe three Offices (excluding none) in ſome form or other are concern'd in the Warrants and Writs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Parliament.</p>

When the chief Officer of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice did paſs under the Title of Keeper, or Clerk of the Privy Seal, moſt of them were Eccleſiaſticks, yet having this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he had his Writ of Summons and Place in the Lords Houſe, as may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the Rolls of 15 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. when Sir <hi>William Keldſly</hi> was Keeper of the Privy Seal, and 20 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. when Mr. <hi>Jo.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>BEfore I proceed to the Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the Individuals of theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſ.</hi> I.</note> I ſhall give a brief deſcription of the nature of them; and firſt as for the word Duke, it is the ſame with <hi>Dux</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> (from <hi>Duco</hi> to lead) for they were antiently Leaders of Armies, and thereby gain'd that Title, (as might be ſhewn from Hiſtories) and were it not for hindering my other intentions, I might recite moſt of the Learned <hi>Seldens</hi> Authorities, (which he hath rendred from other Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Dukes) but in ſhort he tels us that <hi>Comes i. e.</hi> a Count or Earl was eſteemed of an higher quality than Duke, and that Earl was chief in Matters Civil, and Duke in Matters Military; but in proceſs of time the Sword got the upper hand, and prioritie of Earl; and further ſaith that both Dukes and Earls from Subſtitutes to their Princes, (in certain dependent Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories) became afterwards Soveraigns, (as the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> &amp;c. and the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. (ſtill owning the Titles of Dukes or Earls, though they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65438:77"/>had gain'd an intire and independent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The diverſity of Names attributed to Dukes, both in ſacred, prophane, and modern ſtories, were according to the humour of the region where they ſway'd; for in ſome Nations he was call'd <hi>Princeps, Magnus, Illuſtriſſimus, Robuſtus, Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius,</hi> (that is a Duke, or Leader of a Thouſand Men) in other Countries, <hi>Grave, Waiward,</hi> and <hi>Deſpot,</hi> and ſtill the words Duke and Earl, promiſcuouſly us'd to one and the ſame Perſon: but whatever they were or are in foreign parts, Dukes are now in <hi>England</hi> accounted the chief and moſt honourable Subjects, and firſt Degree of Nobility (except Princes or Dukes of the Blood-Royal) and, as a diſtinction from the reſt, is call'd <hi>Grace</hi>) given to no other Spiritual Lord, but the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and to no other Temporal Lord, (except to the Lord High Steward, <hi>pro hac vice,</hi> upon tryal of Peers) for the Princes and Dukes of the Blood, are intituled <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and all the other Temporal Lords, <hi>Right Honourable,</hi> but any of thoſe being Admiral or General, <hi>Excellence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Title of Duke was very probably us'd here in <hi>England</hi> before <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time; for Hiſtory tells us of <hi>Aſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piodolus,</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:65438:77"/>Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> in <hi>Anno Chriſti,</hi> 232. (which was in the time of our old <hi>Britains</hi>) and well might he be call'd Duke, for diſgarriſoning of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Holds,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prideaux</hi> Introduct. to Hiſt.</note> and for his quick Marches to <hi>London,</hi> and killing the Governour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and for many other Heroick Actions, in freeing his Country from their Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. However, there were many Dukes Created in <hi>Germany</hi> about that time. But our Hiſtory tells us, That none was Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Duke in <hi>England,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Selden. Speed<hi>'s Acts.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65438:80"/>Of theſe <hi>Counts</hi> the learned <hi>Selden</hi> reckons but 6 Sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Single Count,</hi> (who hath no addition but his Chriſtian name) <hi>2d.

But I find that <hi>Caſſiodorus</hi> in his <hi>6th.</hi> Book mentions 22 Sorts more than Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> of which 6 of Mr. <hi>Seldens,</hi> or 28 of <hi>Caſſiodorus,</hi> we in <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but few, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Count</hi> of a County, (as <hi>Algernonus, Comes Northumbriae;</hi> A <hi>Count</hi> of a City, (as <hi>Albericus</hi> or <hi>Awbry, Comes Oxoniae</hi> (or <hi>Oxford,</hi>) and <hi>Guilel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Comes Novi Caſtri</hi> or <hi>New Caſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> (being both a Caſtle and Burrough.)</p>

                  <p n="5">5. This Tutelage of grounds gain'd or preſerv'd from waters, was ſo great an honour, that <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> (who was made ſeven times <hi>Conſul</hi> or <hi>Comes,</hi> (for

                  <p n="6">6. And when this Title of Earl was firſt given in <hi>England,</hi> (as tis ſaid) by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the firſt, to <hi>Hugo de Aurank</hi> or <hi>de Ib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinks,</hi> making him Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> it was doubtleſs from ſome eminent Service done in preſerving the Banks or Brinks of that County againſt the inundations of the River <hi>Dee</hi> upon the South-ſide of <hi>Worrcl Ealand</hi> aforeſaid, reaching from the Town of <hi>Cheſter</hi> to the <hi>Hebrea,</hi> for ſhortneſs call'd <hi>Heber,</hi> and ſo round that <hi>Hundred,</hi> (beſides the Banks in other parts of that County.)</p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:65438:82"/>
                  <p>Some do queſtion whether this <hi>d'Aurank</hi> or <hi>d'Ibrink</hi> was the firſt Earl, but tis likely he was ſo Titularly, and other the like Earls before him: but that which is agreed on is, that <hi>Albericus</hi> or <hi>Aubry d'Vere,</hi> was the firſt that was by Charter (or Patent) created Earl by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> who had the additional Title of Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Oxenford</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and continues in that Family to this day; but I cannot paſs the word <hi>Ford,</hi> which doth imply a paſſable Ea or Water, which was neceſſarily to be preſerved from the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of at leaſt 7 ſeveral Rivers in that little County, for the more ſafe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Men and Oxen.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To conclude, Ihope I may be allow'd ſo much of the Art of Tachygraphy or ſhort writing, as may render my applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this word more plauſible, by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Earl</hi> for <hi>Ea Regalia,</hi> ſo as whether <hi>Ea</hi> be conſider'd as a <hi>Saxon</hi> word, or the plural of the pronoun <hi>Ea,</hi> it confirms my notion, and may ſerve as well to explain the word Earl, as <hi>SPQR</hi> the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>DNS</hi> to ſignifie a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of the Realm or Chr. <hi>Chevaleer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. I have ſaid ſufficiently of the word; now as to the antiquity of it in <hi>England,</hi> it is Authentick from Hiſtory and Record, that the word <hi>Earl</hi> and Honour of it, was
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65438:83"/>in uſe in the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> time, and continued with the <hi>Normans,</hi> and Earls had the like extenſive power in Shires and Counties as they have had ſince their formal creation by Charter, which it ſeems was a mode and form not us'd till this to the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſince which there hath been ſome variations in the Form, but eſpecially in the time of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the eighth and King <hi>James,</hi> as will be ſeen when I come to recite ſo much of their Charters of Creation as relate to their intereſts in Parliament.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The learned <hi>Selden</hi> divides this Title into two ſorts, a Local and a Perſonal Earl; by Local he means ſuch Counties, Cities, Caſtles, Towns, or Burroughs, as are fix'd to the Title of Earl, (or <hi>Comes</hi>) as Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>As alſo all ſuch Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls and Viſcounts, as did anciently mount to any of thoſe 4 Degrees, by the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Baronies, which they obtain'd by gift from the King, or other acquiſitions, ſo differing from the other 4 in Nominal gradations, rather than Eſſential. And though there were Nominal differences antiently in the Tenures of Dukes, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, and Barons, yet they were all ſubject to a general Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution to the Kings affairs, according to their certain number of Knights Fees; for as Baronies made the other 4 Superior Degrees, ſo the increment of Knights Fees (whereupon I conceive Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> made that Degree of <hi>Nobiles Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>) did capacitate a Baron to be made
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65438:86"/>a Baron, and ſo a certain number of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies to be a Viſcount and Earl, and of <hi>Earledoms</hi> to be a Duke, as may be read in Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> (and others more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient by him cited) and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving the Knight) ſaith that <hi>Iſtud verbum Baro eſt caput &amp; ſcala dignitatum Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, i. e.

                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>I Have ſhewn in Chap. 2. how Parliament Writs are ſorted into Cloſe Writs, and Open Writs or Patents, and thoſe into Exemplars and Conſimilars. I need not inlarge more therein, but proceed to the firſt Exemplar Writ of Summons, and ſo to other ſuch Writs of Summons to other Degrees as concern the <hi>Lords Houſe;</hi> for I ſhall ſpeak of other Parliament-Writs of another nature, when I have diſpatcht the Summoning Writs and Patents of Creation, according to the method of <hi>Pawns</hi> and <hi>Clauſe-Rolls</hi> made before the <hi>Act of Precedency,</hi> as alſo in all <hi>Pawns</hi> ſince that Act. Thoſe of the Bloud-Royal are placed in the firſt Rank of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and were ſtill Exemplar to the reſt, and therefore the Writ which I am now to ſpeak of, <hi>viz.</hi> To the Duke of <hi>York</hi> (Brother to King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi>)
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65438:90"/>is the Exemplar of the Conſimilar Writ to Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> Duke of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> (being Son to the Siſter of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt) and ſo perſuant not only to the ſaid Act, but to the moſt ancient methods of Writs of Summons, (as will be more fully ſhewn in the following Chapters.)</p>
                  <p>But before I recite this Writ, methinks I hear ſome ſay, <hi>Nolumus conſuetudines Angliae mutare,</hi> therefore let us know what Writs of this nature were iſſued in former Ages by former Kings, which is a Queſtion ſo pertinent to my own ſcruples, that (I hope) the ſame eaſe I gave to my ſelf (after my inquiry) will ſerve to ſatisfie others; for having gone backward with as much ſafety (to the avouching of Records as I could,) and being not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with what was delivered to us, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Parliament Writs in the <hi>Brittiſh, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Danes, Saxons,</hi> or <hi>Norman</hi> times, or by ſome of the <hi>Plantagenets,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>Hen. 3ds.</hi> time, from whence moſt Writers of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliaments take their Original; I fixt upon and took my Riſe from the Writs in the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Edw. 2d.</hi> which are clear and ſtill extant in the Records of the Tower, which the other are not.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Records it is evident, that in 97. Parliaments, as I account them, which were Summon'd from that <hi>15th.</hi> year to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65438:90"/>this Parliament, there is no material dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in this Exemplar Writ from thoſe Antecedent; and therefore that this Writ to the Duke of <hi>York</hi> may be compar'd with that of <hi>Edw. 2d.</hi> I have here ſet them both down <hi>verbatim,</hi> ſo that upon 339. years experience, <hi>viz.</hi> from the year 1322. to the year 1661. Incluſive, we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce, that we in this Age have not much treſpaſs't or varied from the ancient and wiſe Form preſcribed to us by ſo many former Kings, and continued to this time.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Princes of the Bloud have been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilars, when Princes of the Bloud have been Exemplars, as in the 25 <hi>Edw. 3d.

               <p n="2">2. Before I proceed to diſcourſe of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops or Biſhops, it is convenient to look back to the ſeveral Titles which were given to thoſe who were Managers of the Religion practis'd in this Iſland, before the name of Biſhop was here known.</p>
               <p>This Religion was by the <hi>Jews</hi> call'd <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and the Profeſſors thereof <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Panims, Ethnicks, Gentiles, Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> which Titles are all of the ſame nature. The word <hi>Pagan</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the other five, only the word <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> was not uſed till after Chriſts time; and then thoſe who did not believe the Chriſtian Religion, were by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans called Infidels or Unbelievers; but the word in <hi>Hebrew</hi> for <hi>Pagan</hi> was uſed (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the building of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedeck,</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:65438:97"/>before call'd King of <hi>Salem</hi>) when thoſe who did live in neighbouring Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages or more remote places, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to partake in the Devotions offer'd to God in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were from <hi>Pagus</hi> a Village called <hi>Pagani,</hi> or refuſers of that Religion which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> did practice there; and whoever afterwards were not of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, were called <hi>Pagans, &amp;c.</hi> (as <hi>Plautus</hi> calls all who were not <hi>Grecians, Barbaros,</hi> or <hi>Barbarians</hi>) So that the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion is to be eſteem'd, but as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion adulterated by the Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Noah,</hi> who (growing numerous) ſpread themſelves into many parts of the World, and by mixing with other Nations perverted their Primary Religion (which they had from <hi>Noah,</hi> (and afterward more methodically dictated from their High Prieſt <hi>Melchizedeck</hi>) into <hi>Paganiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This mixt Religion was brought into this Iſland by <hi>Meſech</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> Son of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> who here call'd himſelf <hi>Samothes,</hi> and after <hi>Samothes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Shanon, Druis, Bardus, Longobardus,</hi> and <hi>Celtes,</hi> ſucceeded each other; (Seven in all) who being Prieſts were alſo call'd Princes of this Iſland: The <hi>Hebrews</hi> (and <hi>Welſh</hi> (who ſome ſay had moſt of their native Language from the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) uſing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65438:98"/>the ſame word for Prince and Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe Seven were men of great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gain'd partly by tradition from <hi>Noah,</hi> and partly by being contemporary with <hi>Sibylla Samia,</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> from one they learned the Prophecies of Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and Sufferings; from the other, the high ſpeculations of the Souls immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and tranſmigration: of which I ſhall ſpeak more in my Annotations.</p>
               <p>Of theſe and the Founders of this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and their Doctrines, I ſhall give a more large account in my Annotations, as well for the vindication of that diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced Book of <hi>Beroſus,</hi> publiſht by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes Annius,</hi> as to free this Iſland from the common imputation of a pitifull illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate ſort of People, which either the lazineſs of later Writers, (though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſerving) inclin'd them to think it not worth their while to abſtract the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of what was true, from what was meerly fabulous; or the Maliciouſneſs of others, whoſe intereſt it was to ſuppreſs the Records of the Ancient Renown of this Iſland; ſuch as might have demonſtrated their variety of knowledge in all kinds of Literature.</p>
               <p>For the preſent I ſhall only ſelect two of thoſe 7 Wiſemen of <hi>Brittain,</hi> as moſt eminent in Philoſophy, Policy, and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Druis</hi> is ſet forth in Hiſtory to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> (from whom tis alſo ſaid that <hi>Timagoras</hi> brought the <hi>Greek</hi> Letters to <hi>Athens</hi>) He took upon him to be Judge in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and performed all the Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of that Religion in <hi>Groves,</hi> (imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the Idolatrous <hi>Jews</hi>) which <hi>Groves</hi> chiefly conſiſted of Oaks, (as a Tree ſacred to <hi>Jupiter</hi>) and from thence (ſay they) he took his name <hi>Druis,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifying an Oak) however he was Founder of the Sects called <hi>Druids</hi> in this Iſland.</p>
               <p>The other was <hi>Bardus</hi> the Founder of the Sect of the <hi>Bards,</hi> Learned alſo in Magick-Philoſophy, (in the beſt ſence, as Studiers of Wiſdom and Inquirers into the energy and activity of natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents) and Politicks; but they were more Famed for their skill in Poetry and Muſick; and thereby did cheerfully Sing Rime, and ſo (like <hi>Orpheus</hi>) charm men into Civil Religion, and Heroick Actions.</p>
               <p>From theſe did ſpring (as I ſaid) the two Sects of <hi>Druids</hi> and <hi>Bards;</hi> which our <hi>Brittiſh-Welſh, Roman</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Hiſtories do ſo often mention, that there is no doubt concerning them.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:65438:99"/>
               <p>The <hi>Bards</hi> continue even to this day in ſome parts of <hi>Wales,</hi> (of which I ſhall ſpeak more) but the <hi>Druids</hi> being afterwards more imployed in the Prieſtly Functions, and growing numerous when the <hi>Romans</hi> were Poſſeſſors of this Iſland, (and had divided its Government into Three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces) they alſo committed the charge of the Religious Duties within theſe 3 Provinces, to Three of the chiefeſt <hi>Druids,</hi> (altering their Title from <hi>Druids</hi> into <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamins,</hi> and the leſſer <hi>Druids</hi> into the Title of <hi>Flamins,</hi> (for ſo was the Eccleſiaſtical conſtitution among the Old <hi>Romans</hi>) the chief of the Three <hi>Archflamins</hi> being there called <hi>Flamen Dialis,</hi> or <hi>Jupiters Archfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> or High Prieſt; and as thoſe there, were Subject to the Senate, or Empire of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo now theſe here, were Subject to the Emperors, Kings, or Governours of this Iſland, not diſputing their power to alter, put in or out, as they ſaw juſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Archflamins</hi> and <hi>Flamins</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till ſome time after the coming of Chriſt; but when they perceived that the Oracles of the <hi>Sibylls</hi> (which they had ſo long adored) were fulfill'd by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and paſſion of Chriſt) and that all Oracles were ceaſed, theſe <hi>Flamins, Druids</hi> and <hi>Bards,</hi> did give way to the Chriſtian Inſtitutions, (as will be ſhewn.)</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:65438:99"/>
               <p>But to reduce this Section to the ſubject in hand, it doth appear by our moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hiſtories, that theſe <hi>Druids</hi> and <hi>Bards</hi> were conſulted with both in Peace and War, both in the <hi>Brittiſh, Romans,</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> time, even to the coming of Chriſt; though the form of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and mixing with the Laicks, do not appear (for reaſons before alledged) now. I ſhall proceed to ſhew the Inſtitution of Chriſtianity inſtead of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and then the Titles of ſuch as did manage it in this Iſland, and how they were ſtill mixt in Civil Councils.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Religion which ſucceeded <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> in this Iſland, was the Chriſtian, which had its denomination from Chriſt; who may be ſaid to have been before his death in this Iſland, Prophetically, Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and Nominally; but leaſt I ſhould divert the Reader too much from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod intended in this Treatiſe, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the diſcourſe of thoſe 3 points to my Annotations.</p>
               <p>But concerning the introducing of Chriſtianity into this Iſland of <hi>Brittain,</hi> what is moſt credited in our Hiſtories, is, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> (the ſame who beg'd the Body of Chriſt after his Crucifixion) with 12 Diſciples more, are ſaid to plant it here within Thirty Years
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65438:100"/>after Chriſts Reſurrection; and <hi>Ariſtobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> (being, before his coming, Ordained Biſhop of <hi>Brittain</hi>) was one of the 12 which were ſent with <hi>Joſeph</hi> to take care of his charge here: and this is that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtobulus</hi> mentioned by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Romans, Cap.</hi> 16. <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. who was the firſt Biſhop we in theſe parts hear of, (being 5 years before any was made Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>) which brings me to the diſcourſe of the ſeveral Titles of ſuch as were the firſt Managers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The firſt Titles which were given to the Managers of Chriſtanity, were to Chriſt himſelf, who by St. <hi>Paul, Matth.</hi> 21.4. is called the Prophet of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and by St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 3.1. High Prieſt and Apoſtle, and He by his Divine Authority did conſtitute 12 Apoſtles (<hi>Matth.</hi> 10.1. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.13.) by particular names) who were called both Diſciples and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: but the Selected 12. were of an higher nature; for ſome of them were alſo called Evangeliſts, (and none of the Diſciples had that Title, except St. <hi>Luke,</hi> one of the 4. nor any call'd an Apoſtle, (except thoſe 12.) but St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. And theſe 12 Apoſtles were of ſo eminent a Degree, that it is ſaid in the <hi>Revelations Cap.</hi> 21. and 14. that the names of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65438:100"/>Twelve Apoſtles were writ on the 12 Foundations of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After theſe 12. Chriſt did Conſtitute 70. other Diſciples of a leſſer Degree; but the names of theſe 70. are no where cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be found; however we have the Scripture to juſtifie the number of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty; and there were alſo thoſe who were called <hi>Presbyteri,</hi> alſo Deacons, of which Deacons the Eccleſiaſtical Stories tell us of 7. by name, but no number of the names of the <hi>Presbyteri;</hi> however theſe remaining Apoſtles, Diſciples, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Deacons, were ſoon reduced into the Title of Biſhops, (in all places) not by ordinary Inſtitution, but by an higher and a more extraordinary Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and theſe Biſhops among themſelves had alſo ſeveral eminent Titles of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, (within few years after Chriſts death, according as their charge of Souls did extend) <hi>viz. Epiſcopus, Patriarcha, Archiepiſcopus, Papa, Presbyter, Inſpector, Paſtor, Curator, Obſervator, Miniſter, &amp; Cuſtos animarum,</hi> which 7 laſt Titles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but deſcriptions of the Office of the 4 chiefeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhops, Patriarchs, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Popes: I ſhall ſpeak firſt of theſe 4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is evident that the firſt eminent Title in the Eccleſiaſtical affairs of Chriſtianity,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65438:101"/>was the Title of Biſhop; the <hi>Presbyteri</hi> ſtill ſubmitting to the Biſhop whenever he was placed over them.)</p>
               <p>This Title of Biſhop (as I ſaid) was placed on ſome of the Original Apoſtles and Diſciples; as St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>Mark, &amp;c.</hi> for the word <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> doth properly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie one that doth Inſpect or Circumſpect all the concerns of Chriſtian Religion; ſo as thoſe who live under him may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to a Good and Pious Life ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Rules of Chriſtianity, (whoſe duty is more particularly expreſt in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Tim. Cap.</hi> 3.) ſo that the word <hi>Epiſcopus,</hi> as the Superior Order, was more generally uſed than any other Title wherever Chriſtianity was practiſed; Yet other Titles were alſo uſed in ſeveral parts of the World, as they did agree with the Idiom of their native Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Hebrews</hi> called their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Princeps, Sacerdos, Patriarcha.</hi> (<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarcha</hi> was alſo apply'd to the Fathers or chief of every one of the 12 Tribes as upon a Civil account, ſo alſo upon the Eccleſiaſtick) The <hi>Syrians, Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Paſtor, Miniſter,</hi> and <hi>Curator ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum:</hi> The <hi>Arabians, Paſtor,</hi> and <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator animarum:</hi> The <hi>Aethiopians, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, Paſtor,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtos animarum:</hi> The <hi>Graecians, Patriarcha, &amp; Archiepiſcopus,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65438:101"/>&amp; Paſtor animarum,</hi> (all which are thus ſo rendred into <hi>Latine</hi> by Dr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s <hi>Polyglotta</hi> from the Oriental tongues;) ſo as the 4 chief Titles and the others hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one ſignification, and thoſe Titles diſperſed into ſeveral Regions, every one uſing what they thought fit in their own Territories, I ſhall only betake my ſelf to <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> and <hi>Papa,</hi> as having been uſed not only in <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> but more univerſally in moſt parts of the World, (unleſs we admit <hi>Presbyter</hi> from <hi>Presbyter-Johns</hi> Country to be an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Title) So having ſhewn the meaning of the word Biſhop in general, the Antiquity of it is not to be paſt over. The <hi>Jewiſh Graecians</hi> did uſe it in their Old-Teſtament, for in <hi>Pſal.</hi> the 109.28. they read <hi>Epiſcopatum ejus accipiet alter,</hi> (which very Text St. <hi>Luke</hi> cites in the Firſt of the <hi>Acts v.</hi> 20. upon the Election of <hi>Matthias</hi> to be an Apoſtle, (inſtead of <hi>Judas</hi>) <hi>viz. Let another take his Biſhoprick,</hi> which ſhew that the word was in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Graecians</hi> before Chriſts time, and was no new impoſed word upon the Chriſtians, but a compliance with <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Titles to win the circumciz'd <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Greece;</hi> and this may be ſaid, that though <hi>Rome</hi> did change the name from Biſhop to Patriarck, Archbiſhop, and Pope, which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65438:102"/>ſignifies no more than Father or chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet <hi>Brittain</hi> hath been very conſtant to the name of Biſhop, and did not take upon it Archbiſhop till the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius Chlorus</hi> or the Pope, thought it worthy of that Title.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In this Section I place <hi>Brittain</hi> before <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe our Hiſtories tell us that <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> was ordained Biſhop of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> (and <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> there with him) 5 years before <hi>Linus,</hi> (the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>) and ſo now I ſhall take a ſhort view of the Priority and Succeſſions in both places, relating to the ſubject of this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> is affirmed, as I ſaid, to be the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and ſome few years before any Biſhop was Conſtituted at <hi>Rome;</hi> but what the names were of ſuch Biſhops as ſucceeded him, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; (for the reaſons before given) but the Story relates, That about an 100. years after Chriſt, one <hi>Lucius</hi> was King of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and was the firſt King of this Iſland who embraced the Chriſtian Religion. Whereupon he ſent <hi>Damianus</hi> and <hi>Fugatius</hi> to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> then Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo it is very probable they were Biſhops and Succeſſors to <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> and Inſtruments of the Kings Converſion; for none elſe could be ſuppoſed to make attempts on
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65438:102"/>the King, but ſuch whoſe eminent Titles and Employments did give them the more opportune admiſſion; and doubtleſs theſe were very conſiderable Perſons, eſpecially <hi>Damianus,</hi> whoſe very name continues at <hi>Rome</hi> even to this day in great renown; for we find that at one time, a Biſhop was of that name, and at another time a Biſhop Cardinal, and a Church is ſtill in <hi>Rome,</hi> (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated <hi>Sancto Coſmo,</hi> and <hi>Damiano</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to one of the 14 Deacon-Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. Theſe two Biſhops, or at leaſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſons, were ſent to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> to confer about the ordering of the Church-Affairs, and it ſeems they did acquaint the Pope, (as appears by that Letter) that King <hi>Lucius</hi> had the Old Teſtament, and the Writings of the Apoſtles, called the New Teſtament; ſo that the Chriſtian Doctrine being fixt here, there ſeemed nothing more to be done, than to ſettle the Diſcipline, and the means for its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; wherein it may be juſtly collected, that the King deſired ſuch concurrence with the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> as might not diſoblige him or the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour <hi>Commodus,</hi> to whom he was a Tributary, and with whom in all Civil matters this King ſtood then more fair and quiet than his Predeceſſors had done before him.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:65438:103"/>
               <p n="7">7. I have given a brief account of the Managers of the Chriſtian Religion in <hi>Brittain,</hi> from <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> to <hi>Damianus</hi> and <hi>Fugatius,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Lucius.</hi> I will now ſee what was done at <hi>Rome</hi> in that time, concerning which their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries tell us that <hi>Linus</hi> was the firſt Biſhop, (who according to computation, was 5 years after <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Brittain</hi>) but St. <hi>Jerome</hi> is as zealous to have St. <hi>Peter</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Linus,</hi> as <hi>Ireneus</hi> to have <hi>Linus</hi> the Firſt, (two great Fathers of that Church) ſo that if St. <hi>Peter</hi> be firſt, then we muſt account 13 to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> (before named) if <hi>Linus,</hi> then <hi>Eleutherius</hi> is the <hi>12th.</hi> (and with this computation of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> moſt Hiſtories do agree) The firſt Eight of theſe Twelve had no other Title than Biſhop; till <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Ninth of that See, took upon him the name of <hi>Papa</hi> or <hi>Pope,</hi> (and afterwards <hi>Hildebrand</hi> call'd <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> challenged it as his ſole right to be called Pope) and ſo <hi>Eleutherius</hi> being the <hi>4th.</hi> Pope from <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and the <hi>9th.</hi> in Succeſſion from <hi>Linus,</hi> did return a kind Anſwer to King <hi>Lucius,</hi> by two eminent Perſons which the Pope alſo ſent, <hi>viz. Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus</hi> and <hi>Meduanus,</hi> and with them a Letter, which may be read at large, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65438:103"/>in the Pope takes notice that the Old and New Teſtament were then in <hi>Brittain,</hi> and in that Letter (leaving the ordering of Eccleſiaſtical affairs in <hi>Brittain</hi> to the King) declared him to be Chriſts Vicar in his own Kingdom: which made King <hi>Lucius</hi> go cheerfully on, and (as Hiſtory tells us) that whereas the <hi>Archflamins</hi> had been the chief Managers of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion in this Iſle, (each having one Province) the King reduced thoſe Three Provinces to Two, and placed Two Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops therein, and inſtead of the <hi>Flamins</hi> did conſtitute Biſhops, and ſo there was an amity between the Archbiſhops and Biſhops of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and the Archbiſhops or Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither of them ſtrugling for Priority, but ſtill carrying on the work of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>But the Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> declining in their power, and the Pope ſtill taking advantage of their declinations, grew at laſt ſo conſiderable with the Emperours, that they could not ſafely deny them any thing; ſo that whereas the Emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> formerly had the diſpoſal of their Popes, and the Kings of <hi>Brittain</hi> of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, (and ſo other Princes in their Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) the Popes by degrees did take the power to themſelves, to make what Biſhops they pleaſed, to ſummon Councils, make De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65438:104"/>diſtribute them, and enjoyned obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Univerſal Juriſdiction, that the name of Pope might be the more authentick.</p>
               <p>It was uſed in many parts of the World beſides <hi>Rome;</hi> for (it is ſaid) that about 300. years after Chriſt, <hi>Neſtorius</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick had 6000. Biſhops appeared againſt him, which were under the Government of ſeveral Popes, and this was above 300. years before <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> (Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing as well as Biſhops) who obtained of <hi>Phocas</hi> then Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> that none ſhould be called Pope, but the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> and though <hi>Gregory</hi> (the firſt) his immediate Predeceſſor, (but one) declared againſt it, and many Popes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, yet <hi>Boniface</hi> having obtained this Supremacy (what he did in other Kingdoms I ſhall omit) in <hi>Brittain,</hi> to make ſure that none ſhould be placed there, but ſuch as ſhould be dependent on <hi>Rome;</hi> he confirm'd <hi>Auguſtin</hi> a Monk the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (being made ſo by his ſaid Predeceſſor <hi>Gregory</hi>) and ſoon after, he and 4 ſucceeding <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces</hi> filled up all the reſt of the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, with ſuch Foraigners or others as had a clear dependance on <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, Stipends,</hi> or Forraign Intereſts, (amongſt the reſt, <hi>Faelix</hi> a <hi>Burgundian</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:65438:104"/>was made Biſhop of <hi>Dunwich,</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> (the fifth Biſhoprick then in rank, of which I ſhall ſpeak more) and ſo in a few years after, all the Biſhopricks which were then, and ſoon after added, were filled up with his dependents, as alſo all Abbies, Priories, Monaſteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to be ſupplied according to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment from <hi>Rome</hi> without any mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial oppoſition by the Kings of this Iſland, (but ſuch as hereafter mentioned.) And having this Power, it was no hard matter to fix themſelves into all Councils within this Kingdom; for in all Hiſtories we find them as Actors therein, and in reſpect of their Eccleſiaſtical Intereſts, one of the Eſtates; and when the name of Parliament was given to our chief Council, they were methodically fix'd in the ſecond rank of the <hi>Pawns,</hi> and ſo in the <hi>Clauſe Rolls:</hi> and this place in Parliament was never denied them whilſt they continued here. But the Pope's Power and Supremacy over this Iſland was ever diſguſted by our ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Kings; yet being back'd by ſo great a Temporal Prince (as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>) joyned with the Intereſt which by long continuance they had gained from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, the Kings of this Iſland had little ſucceſs in their ſtruglings.

               <p>And in this great Alteration, doubtleſs, there was alſo a Divine Hand; for as Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third (before mentioned) did put out all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, and placed Foreigners (his creatures) in their rooms, and made many more Biſhopricks than he found; ſo now, by the <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> (Like for Like) <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth did put out all the Pope's dependents, and placed ſuch Biſhops in their rooms as would juſtifie the King's Supremacy here, and renounce the Pope's.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65438:110"/>they thought it convenient to return to the Primitive way of Ariſtocracy, and ſet up Presbytery (that original Government as was pretended,) and thereupon one &amp; all cried againſt Biſhops (which bravely workt for the Papal intereſt;) &amp; the clamour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo geat that the Learned King <hi>James</hi> did what he could by Writing to quiet them, &amp; his unfortunate, thought Bleſſed Son, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt tried it by Action, but without Succeſs.

               <p>Now ſee what followed; inſtead of making of Earls, Knights and Squires, and maintaining of Hoſpitals, as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> (as I ſaid) the Biſhops were not only put out of the Houſe of Lords, but the Temporal Lords ſoon after, and the Knights and Squires ſecluded from the Houſe of Commons, and the Hoſpitals, (and all) ruined by an inteſtine Bloody War, the King Sacrificed, and every one of the Machineers diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of their original plauſible inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;

               <p n="12">12.

               <p>Though all the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> at their Coronation, are Sworn to defend the Chriſtian Faith, and the words <hi>defenſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Eccleſiae Anglicanae,</hi> having been in moſt Parliament-Writs ſince the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> Yet the Pope (as I ſaid, for the good Service which <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. had done, in Writing againſt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>) ſent him a Bull, and therein inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled him <hi>Defenſor Fidei,</hi> with this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it ſhould be placed next his Title to <hi>France,</hi> and before his Title to <hi>Ireland;</hi> and it may be obſerved, That in the ſame year he ſent the like Bull to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> intituling him alſo <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor Fidei;</hi> upon which the Emperor took an Oath, not only to be <hi>Defenſor Fidei,</hi>

In the 32. year he left out the word <hi>immediately,</hi> and the next year the words <hi>under Chriſt.</hi> So that, in the 33 of his Reign the Title was <hi>Hen. by the Grace of God King of</hi> England, France, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>Defender of the Faith, and of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and alſo of</hi> Ireland, <hi>on Earth Supream Head.</hi> And thus by making himſelf King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed

And the like did Queen <hi>Mary</hi> in the firſt year of her Reign; but upon her Marriage with King <hi>Philip,</hi> in the ſecond year of her Reign, (and firſt of both) their Title was <hi>King and Queen of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> France, Naples, Jeruſalem <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>Defenders of the Faith, Princes of</hi> Spain <hi>and</hi> Cicily, <hi>Arch-Dukes of</hi> Auſtria, <hi>Duke of</hi> Milan, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy <hi>and</hi> Brabant, <hi>Counteſs of Hasburgh, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Tyroll,</hi> quite joſtling out <hi>Supream Head</hi> during their Reigns.</p>
               <p>When Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown, the Circumſcription of her Great Seal was <hi>Elizabetha Dei gratiâ Angliae, Franciae &amp; Hiberniae Regina, Fidei De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſor,</hi> yet ſhe maintained both Titles of <hi>Defenſor</hi> and <hi>Supream</hi> during her Reign.</p>
               <p>When King <hi>James</hi> came to the Crown, the Circumſcription of his Broad Seal was alſo <hi>Jacobus Dei gratiâ Angliae, Scotiae, Franciae &amp; Hiberniae Rex, Fidei Defenſor,</hi> and no more; yet he maintained the other Point both in his Government and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as may be read in his <hi>Praemonition to

               </p>
               <p>When King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt came to his Crown, the Circumſcription of his Great Seal was <hi>Carolus Dei gratiâ Rex Angliae, Scotiae, Franciae &amp; Hiberniae, Fidei Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> and no more; yet to juſtifie both Titles, in the ſeventeenth year of his Reign he cauſed the 39 <hi>Articles</hi> (which were agreed on in the fourth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) to be reprinted, and in the Front did publiſh his own Declaration in theſe words: <hi>Being by God's Ordinance, according to our juſt Titles, Defender of the Faith, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Governour of the Church within theſe Our Dominions,</hi> He therein <hi>declares, That the Articles of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and authorized heretofore, do contain the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and requires his Subjects to continue in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form profeſſion thereof. And</hi> then, as to the Diſcipline he <hi>further declares himſelf Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65438:113"/>Governor of the Church of</hi> England, and <hi>that if any difference ariſe about the external Policy concerning Injunctions, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, or other Conſtitutions whatſoever thereunto belonging, the Clergy in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations is to order and ſettle them,</hi> (having firſt obtained leave under his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Broad Seal ſo to do) and <hi>he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their ſaid Ordinances and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> So here the word <hi>Supream Head</hi> is changed into <hi>Supream Governour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second came to the Crown, the Circumſcription of his Broad Seal was <hi>Carolus Secundus Dei gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ Angliae, Scotiae, Franciae &amp; Hiberniae Rex, Fidei Defenſor,</hi> and no more; yet to juſtifie both Titles, the very ſame year of his Return, <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. he publiſh'd a Declaration to all his loving Subjects (well worth the reading) concerning Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Affairs, which ſhews both his Chriſtian condeſcention to his Subjects, and Juſtifications to thoſe two Titles for which he is ſtyl'd by Writers <hi>Supream Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator.</hi>

               <p>Theſe and other matters (ſeeming trivial, though proving dangerous in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences) were yielded to as condeſcentions to gratifie a <hi>diſſenting party</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who, very probably, were incited thereunto, by underworking Papal Contrivers, (being excellent Artiſts in ſpurring on the leaſt humour of Schiſm in this Church) and ſo dealing in little things till greater were ripen'd, in which latter they often made Attempts, as may be read in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and this preſent King's time (yet without ſucceſs) except in the Aſſaſſination of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, which was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd with ſuch dexterity, that it was made difficult to judge whether ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſenters in thoſe times, or the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Incenſors were the chief Actors. And after that it was carried on by a ſubtil way of redeeming their credits in this King's Preſervation at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> yet ſtill
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65438:114"/>underhand endeavouring to ſubvert the whole Fabrick of this Kingdom, as was diſcovered about the end of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1678. (which determin'd my publick Employments, and therefore ſhall leave that Subject to other Pens.)</p>
               <p>Thus the new Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> and the old Empire of <hi>England</hi> have ſtrugled through many Ages for Supremacy.</p>
               <p>It is the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to be quiet within its own liquid Arms, and ſo increaſe it ſelf, with other Kingdoms and States, by a real mutual Traffick and Commerce. But it is the Intereſt of <hi>Rome</hi> to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and increaſe it ſelf in all Kingdoms and States, without any real commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or advantage to any but it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Yet it is difficult to make the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to the Church of <hi>England</hi> believe that the way which they take in oppoſing <hi>Rome</hi> will in time be deſtructive to their own Deſigns and Opinions. Some of the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> to the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſee and know this, yet are ſo inveigled by ſuch <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> (who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be for that Church, but not for that Court) under a plauſible notion of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as may deſtroy that which they ought to maintain, <hi>viz.</hi> to prevent the Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby they bring it to this Queſtion, Whether they had better
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65438:114"/>comply with a Foreign Intereſt, which they pretend to hate, or their Native In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, which they pretend to love; and whether they are not like (by concurring with thoſe pretended half <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> which they do in effect, by oppoſing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitutions) to fall into that which they pretend to avoid. For theſe admitting one Error, are ſubject by thoſe deluſions to ſtrike upon greater, becauſe they who now are only for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the Court, will undoubtedly (when they have gain'd their Proſelytes) be both for the Church and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they have once the Diſſenters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be its Oppoſers; for Diſſention mounts as naturally to violent Oppoſition, as Conſpiracies to Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
               <p>And now, craving pardon for this long digreſſion, I ſhall proceed to the Writs by which the Biſhops have been anciently and ſtill are Summon'd to ſit in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Cum Praelatis Magnatibus &amp; Proceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> giving this Hint, That their Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to Parliament were ſtill in relation to their Baronies, and their advancements to other Dignities as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil, was and is in reſpect of their great Learning, Knowledge, Fidelity and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in Affairs.</p>

And ſo in ſome Clauſe Rolls there are Exemplars to the Archbiſhop, but no Conſimilars mentioned; and likewiſe an Exemplar to ſome Temporal Lord, but no Conſimilars named, which doubtleſs was the Error of Clerks, for there are Seal'd Writs of both ſorts, extant at ſuch times as they were omitted in the Rolls.

Popes to this time, yet the Pope hath exerciſed the higheſt Juriſdiction here that <hi>England</hi> could afford, which is a very Partial and unequal way of dealing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>2d.</hi> reaſon of Entring this Writ, is to ſhew that the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> was herein the Exemplar to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> of which there is no Precedent before; for the three Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals which were Archbiſhops, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time of King <hi>John, Edward</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:65438:118"/>and <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> were all three Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> ſo as this prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency muſt be attributed to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Dignity above all Archbiſhops, and not to any irregularity in placing the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar. And here it may be obſerved, that as the Title of Archbiſhop did long ſince leap over the Title of Biſhop, and the Titles of Patriarch and Pope, over Archbiſhops, afterwards, <hi>viz. Anno Chriſti</hi> 1099. when the Title of Cardinal firſt began (by Pope <hi>Paſcal</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> his inſtitution) the Title being rais'd by him, of certain Parochial Prieſts in <hi>Rome</hi> (of whom he had more confidence) did in effect leap over all the Four other Degrees, and by it had the ſole power of Electing Popes, being under their management; ſo as the Pope hath only the Title left, and the 70 Cardinals the power of Electing him, in which they are unwilling to admit of any <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, although if they did, he would be ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballanc'd, that there were no great hazard of his Election. In the mean time, the Conclave is ſo kind to its own Intereſt, as to appoint one of thoſe Cardinals to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of <hi>England,</hi> he being at this day Stiled, <hi>Eminentiſſimus Dominus Franciſcus Cardinalis Barbarinus Angliae Protector.</hi>

Though <hi>H.</hi> 8. might intitle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>Fidei Defenſor</hi> 8 years before this Writ, yet this is the firſt Writ on Record where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Title is given; and this alſo is the laſt Writ, that I find was ſent to any Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to ſit in Parliament; for though Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Pool</hi> was Cardinal, and Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> time; yet he had no Writ, either as Cardinal, or Archbiſhop, or both; but the Exemplar was in that Parliament, to the Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> and no Writs to the Biſhops of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, York, London,</hi> or <hi>Durham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. When this Writ was made, he was Lord Chancellor, yet it is not inſerted in the Writ, poſſibly becauſe Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> was in Proſpect to be Lord Chancellor, and was actually ſo before the Parliament met. And now having ſhewn the firſt Writ among the <hi>Pawns,</hi> I ſhall proceed to the Writs in the ſubſequent <hi>Pawns,</hi> and then ſhew the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>Pawn</hi> or bundle of Writs extant in the Pettibag is of the 31 of <hi>Hen. 8th.</hi> wherein the firſt Writ is to <hi>Thomas</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and this Writ alſo agrees with the former (except in the Titles) and with all the Writs to Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, from <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>2ds.</hi> time to this, as they are in the Clauſe Rolls.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:65438:119"/>
                  <p>The third <hi>Pawn,</hi> or Record of Writs in the Pettibag, is of the 36 of <hi>Hen. 8th.</hi> which is the remarkable Writ, becauſe it differs from all the former Writs ſince <hi>Ed. 2ds.</hi> time, both in the Titles and the Praemonition; for in this Writ he is intituled King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Supream Head; but before this, only Lord of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Now as to the Title of King of <hi>Ireland, Hen.</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> did give the ſame to his Son King <hi>John,</hi> but the Pope would not let him enjoy it; nor did any of his Succeſſors aſſume it, till <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> reſolved to reaſſume it in defiance of the Pope, and writ himſelf King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> inſtead of Lord of <hi>Ireland;</hi> becauſe, as I ſaid in the former Section, he would not place the Title of <hi>Defender,</hi> before <hi>Ireland,</hi> as the Pope had directed him in his Bull; or it may be in reſpect the Pope pretended a Title under King <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Ireland;</hi> and as for the other Title of <hi>Supream Head,</hi> though it was given him by the Parliament 12 years before, yet I find it not in any Parliament Writ till this year of the 36. <hi>H.</hi> 8. So that the Preamble, or Titular part of the Writ is thus, <hi>Henricus Dei gratiâ Angliae Franciae &amp; Hiberniae Rex, fidei Defenſor, &amp; Eccleſiae Anglicanae &amp; Hiberniae Supremum Caput.</hi> Then for the Premonition, whereas the words <hi>Priorem
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65438:120"/>Capellanum</hi> or <hi>Capitulum</hi> were plac'd next unto <hi>Praemonentes;</hi> in this Writ the words were <hi>Praemonentes Decanum &amp; Capitulum,</hi> becauſe Abbies and Priories were newly diſſolv'd, and Deanaries Conſtituted and ſo the Writs thus alter'd have continued till this Writ for the year 1661. But before I ſet down the Writ for 1661, I muſt a little repeat ſome ſhort progreſſes and methods uſhering in that Writ, for though the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were in the year 1641. by an Act of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, with the Conſent of the Lords Temporal, and Commons, diſabled from Exerciſing any Temporal Juriſdiction or Authority; and thereupon, ſoon after put out of the Lords Houſe (as I have ſhewn) yet there was no occaſion of new Writs to them till the year 1661. and then there could be no new Writs made for their Reſtauration, till they were reſtor'd by the ſame power of King, Lords Temporal, and Commons, by repealing that Act; in order to which the remnant of the Parliament of 1640 (which ſtill continued in ſeveral ſhapes) was by the Kings Conſent diſſolv'd, his Majeſty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing another to begin in <hi>April</hi> 1660. So the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1660. he came ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully from beyond Seas to confirm it, and this Parliament laſted till <hi>December</hi> following, in which time, as Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65438:120"/>to the Biſhops Introduction; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were made for reſtoring Miniſters who had been outed of their Livings, and alſo Commiſſioners were appointed (who did ſit accordingly) to compoſe the differences which might ariſe between the Purchaſers of the Biſhops Lands and the Biſhop, wherein they us'd ſo great Lenity, that the Biſhops did come into their Temporalities; (with ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to both Intereſts) (after they had been injoyed by the Purchaſers near Twenty Years) and in the ſame Month his Majeſty did alſo ſet out a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before mention'd, concerning Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Affairs; and after theſe Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, that Parliament conſiſting of the King, Lords Temporal, and Commons, being alſo Diſſolv'd, as I ſaid, in <hi>Decemb.</hi> His Majeſty was pleas'd in <hi>February</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to Summon another Parliament of the Lords Temporal, and Commons, to begin the Eighth of <hi>May</hi> 1661. before which time, his Coronation was Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the Twenty third of <hi>April</hi> 1661. yet before the Ceremony was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, he thought himſelf oblig'd to take Care for the Biſhops, (for many Ceremonies eſſential to his Coronation were to be perform'd by them) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65438:121"/>at a full Council in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> the Tenth of <hi>April,</hi> this Order was made:
<q>ORdered by his Majeſty, That the Lord Chancellor do forthwith give directions to the Clerk of the Crown, to draw up Writs of Summons to paſs his Majeſties Great Seal, directed to the moſt Reverend Father in God, <hi>William</hi> Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Accepted</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> for Convocation of the Lords, Biſhops, Deans, Archdeacons, and the Clergy of their reſpective Provinces in uſual Form.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Accordingly, the Parliament met the ſaid Eighth of <hi>May</hi> 1661. and did ſit till the Thirtieth of <hi>July,</hi> where amongſt other Acts, one did paſs for Repealing the Act of Aboliſhing Biſhops, and Reſtoring them to their Eſtates, Dignities, and Places; and ſo the Parliament Adjourned to the Twentieth of <hi>November</hi> following; after which Adjournment, upon the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ninth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, the Writs which were ordered the Tenth of <hi>April</hi> aforeſaid, did paſs under the Great Seal, and were diſtributed, ſo as the Twentieth of <hi>November</hi> 1661. they did take their places in the Houſe of Lords, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

                  <p>UPon comparing the Writ of <hi>Edw.</hi> the Second, with the middle Writ of <hi>21th.</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eighth, and the Writ of the 13. <hi>Car. Secundi,</hi> theſe follow-Particulars may be obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Titles of ſeveral Kings in their Writs, as well to the Lords Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as Spiritual, have varied according to the Succeſſive Kings Increaſe or Decreaſe of their Dominions, but more remarkably in <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eighths time, relating to the Clergy (as I have ſhewn.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All Writs concerning Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, from <hi>Edward</hi> the Seconds time and before, to the 13. of <hi>Car. Secundi</hi> incluſive, were directed to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as the Exemplar Writ,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65438:123"/>in reſpect of his Dignity, except where any Cardinal was a Biſhop of <hi>England,</hi> or the Popes Vicar-General, or that the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was void, or that a Biſhop was Chancellor; and then the Exemplar Writ was directed to that Biſhop, and to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Archbiſhops; or if both Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopricks were void, then to the Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Exemplar and Conſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Writs to Biſhops, have been generally plac't in the Clauſe-Rolls, and in all the <hi>Pawns</hi> extant before any Degrees, except Princes of the Blood, though their places in the Lords Houſe are otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Sometimes the Writ to the Archbiſhop was without any Epethit to his Chriſtian name; but the Epithet of the moſt conſtant Application was <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabili Archiepiſcopo,</hi> and the like to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; but in <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eighths time it was alter'd, <hi>Reverendiſſimo</hi> to Archbiſhops, and <hi>Reverendo</hi> to Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Alſo an other Title is uſually in the Biſhops Writs; as in the Writs to the Lords Temporal, <hi>viz. Praedilecto &amp; fideli Conciliario,</hi> which is not in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writ; but of late it is entred as an addition to ſuch as are of the Kings Privy Council, whereof the Biſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> is for the moſt part one.</p>

                  <p>Sixthly, In the 36. of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the Writ is, <hi>Primati &amp; Metropolitano,</hi> which latter word was not extant till that Writ.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, In the latter Writs, the words <hi>de adviſamento &amp; aſſenſu Concilii noſtri,</hi> are entred, which are not in the old Waits, and ſome other words which are in the Dukes Writ, and not in the old Writs, as may be obſerved in the Figures which I have placed in that Writ.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, And in the <hi>Mandamus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Firmiter injungentes</hi> to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lords, the Writs to the Biſhops are <hi>Rogando Mandamus;</hi> and inſtead of <hi>Fide &amp; ligeantia</hi> to the Temporal Lords, it is, <hi>In ſide &amp; dilectione</hi> to the Lords Spiritual; ſo that to the word <hi>Praemonentes,</hi> the Writs both to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal do agree, as well in the Originals, as Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, except in thoſe particulars before nam'd.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, From the word <hi>Praemonentes</hi> in the Writ, there is a greater Latitude of power granted to the Lords Spiritual, than to the Lords Temporal; for the Lords Temporal are not impowred by their Writs to Summon the Laity, (who ſit in the Houſe of Commons as Repreſentatives of the Commonalty) but the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65438:124"/>are impowred by their Writs, to Summon Deacons, Archdeans, and Proctors to attend the Parliament, (as Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the Clergy) who being met at places appointed, (diſtinct from the Houſe of Lords, or Houſe of Commons) thoſe places where they meet, have the Titles of Convocations; the Biſhops mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the upper Convocation, the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the Clergy, the lower; Suting to thoſe two of the Laity; one called ſometimes, the Houſe of Lords or Peers, or upper Houſe, the other ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Houſe of Commons, or lower Houſe.</p>
                  <p>The General Writs for this Parliament were dated (as I have ſhewn) the <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1661. to meet the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1661. but the Writs to the Biſhops were not dated, till the 29. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet by theſe Writs, they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to meet <hi>(die &amp; loco)</hi> at the day and place, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Eighth of <hi>May,</hi> and at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as in the General Writs; ſo as the latter Writs ſeem to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an Impoſſibility; but this is to be underſtood in a Parliament-ſence, <hi>viz.</hi> That the firſt day of the Meeting of a Parliament, continues to the end of a Seſſion, or Prorogation, and is accounted but as one day, for an Adjournment is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65438:125"/>but the continuance of that day; and a paſſing of Acts upon an Adjournment (as in this caſe) was not a determining the Seſſion, becauſe they were paſſed by way of Proviſo, That it ſhould not thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue the Parliament; ſo that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops being admitted before any Seſſion of determining the Parliament, or before any Prorogation of it; it is to be eſteem'd in a Parliament-ſence, (as I ſaid) as one day. And ſo it is in Law; where a Sum is due the Eighth of <hi>May,</hi> payable at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and not paid till the 29. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and then paid in <hi>London,</hi> and then accepted by the Creditor; it doth bar all breaches or punctilios in Law or Equity, between the Creditor and Debtor.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, If a Parliament continues ſome Months without Adjournments or Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, in which time many Members of both Houſes Dye, ſo as there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſend out Writs for a Supply of Members; if the Writs ſhould not iſſue in a certain Form, with reſpect to a certain day, though paſt, it would produce many inconveniencies, attending the Diſcretion or Indiſcretion of Clerks who are to form ſuch Writs; and therefore all Writs though after Prorogations, though many years ſubſequent, have ſtill reference to the firſt day of the Parliament, as will be further
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65438:125"/>ſhewn; for it hath been the Wiſdom of Parliaments to admit of no variation in that point.</p>
                  <p>Next, As to the place of Meeting; the Biſhops are Summon'd to meet <hi>Cum Praelatis Magnatibus &amp; proceribus,</hi> at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> which the Biſhops do as to their Co-Intereſt in the Houſe of Lords; but in relation to the inferior Clergy, the Biſhops do meet at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ſometimes Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ to ſuch places out of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as the Archbiſhop or his Vicar appoints; which before the Fire in 1666. was at the <hi>Convocation-Houſe</hi> on the South-ſide of <hi>St. Pauls</hi> Church in <hi>London,</hi> but ſince, in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abby.</hi> The Biſhops in all this Parliament ſit in <hi>Henry</hi> the Sevenths Chappel, (as the upper Convocation) the Deans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in St. <hi>Benedicts</hi> Chappel, on the North-ſide of the <hi>Abby;</hi> (as the lower Convocation) ſo as they have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Houſes or Places from the Houſe of Lords, and Houſe of Commons, as alſo diſtinct days of meeting; but always after the Parliament firſt meets; and ſo of ſitting ſome days after any Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Prorogation, or Diſſolution, which is appointed beyond the Lords or Commons, as will be ſhewn in the Chapter of Convocations.</p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:65438:126"/>
                  <p n="11">11. Concerning the alteration of <hi>Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi> into <hi>Decanum,</hi> I have given an account.</p>

                  <p n="14">14. Till about the year 855. there was not above 16 Biſhopricks, and then they increas'd to 19 and 21, and in <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. time to 26, and ſo they have continued ever ſince; but in all times there have been ſeveral Tranſplacings, and Tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; ſo as the names of the Biſhopricks of <hi>Dorcheſter, Dunwich, Hagleſted, Syd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naceſter,</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter, Landasfirm, Selſy, Sherborn, Cheſter</hi> in <hi>Durham, Crediton,</hi> and St. <hi>Petrocks,</hi> 10 in all, are utterly loſt and drown'd in the now remaining 26 Biſhopricks.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. The Biſhops being men well Educated, in all Sciences Divine and humane, were ſtil imployed by our Succeſſive Kings, as well in matters Temporal, as Spiritual; for I find that of 153 Chancellors, and Keepers of the Great-Seal (from <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours time) there have been 62 Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, and Biſhops employ'd in theſe Offices; and from the firſt Inſtitution of

And being men generally of the greateſt Knowledge and Learning, were thereupon choſen into Offices of the higheſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. That though for many Ages before the end of <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>8th's.</hi> Reign) the Biſhops were then of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, yet whenever they had the leaſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from the preſent Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (and ſometimes without it) they ſtill oppos'd the Superintendency, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy both of the Church and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> (as to the Dominions of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective

And laſtly it may be very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, though their influence and Intereſt (upon a Spiritual, and Temporal account) is ſpread over this whole Kingdom, their Revenues great; and thereby their Tenants, Officiates, and Dependents very numerous; yet I do not find in Hiſtories, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>England</hi> did ever raiſe an Army, to juſtifie their intereſt againſt any of our Kings, or againſt the other two Eſtates, of Lords Temporal, or Commons, by Sword, or Force; but ſtill ſupported it by their Pen, or Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Thus I have given an account of the Managers of Religion in this Iſland;

               <p n="2">2. Theſe two Offices were ſometimes kept diſtinct, and ſometimes united in one Perſon, till the Fifth of <hi>Queen Eliz.</hi> and then it was Enacted, That both thoſe Offices ſhould be accounted but as one and the ſame, and that hereafter both ſhould not be uſed at one time by diſtinct Perſons.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. To manifeſt their Eminency, it is evident from the Rolls, that in the opening
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65438:129"/>of all Parliaments, the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, did conſtantly, by the Command of the King, ſhew them the reaſons of Summoning them, (unleſs in a Vacancy, or on a ſpecial account of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and then it was performed by one of the Chief Juſtices.</p>

               <p n="6">6.

Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> Knt. Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> was made <hi>Cuſtos Sigilli,</hi> and had a particular Writ of Summons to attend that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As to this Writ of 13. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. of which I am to treat, it is to be obſerved that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65438:131"/>the Warrant (before mentioned) ſent to Sir <hi>Edward Hyde</hi> Knt. and Chancellor, to impower him to ſend out Writs, was directed in theſe words, <hi>To our Right Truſty and Well-beloved Counſellor, Sir</hi> Edward Hyde <hi>Knt. Chancellor of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but in his <hi>Latine</hi> Writ of Aſſiſtance, the words are, <hi>Praedilecto &amp; perquam fideli Conſiliario ſuo Edwardo Domino Hyde Cancellario ſuo Angliae:</hi> leaving out <hi>Militi</hi> or <hi>Equiti aurato,</hi> and putting in <hi>Domino;</hi> and the reaſon of this variation (as I conceive) was, That the Warrant was agreed on by the King and Council be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Third of <hi>November,</hi> at which time he was Baron of <hi>Hindon;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Warrant he is named only Sir <hi>Edward Hyde</hi> Knt. but in the Writ, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino Hyde,</hi> which is the Adjunct Title of a Baron, as he then was; and I find before the Parliament met, he was creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Viſcount <hi>Cornbury</hi> and Earl of <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and thereupon had another Writ in relation to thoſe Dignities, which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the <hi>Pawn,</hi> and the entry dated the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> before the Parliament met, and in the latter Writ he had alſo his additional Titles; ſo that I obſerve, that if the Chancellor or Keeper be above the Degree of a Baron, he hath his Writ according to his Degree, and therein only
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65438:132"/>intimating his Chancellorſhip or Keeper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, (as is before ſhewn in the 36. of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eighth. 1 <hi>Mariae, &amp;c.</hi> But if he be not a Baron, then he hath this Aſſiſting Writ, <hi>Quatenus</hi> Chancellor or Keeper, as may be ſeen in the former Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, from the 28. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> to this Writ of 13. <hi>Car.</hi> 2.

                     <hi>SECT. IX.</hi> Obſervations on this Writ.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt I ſhall ſhew how it differs from the Writs to the Nobles; Secondly, How it differs from the Writs to the other Aſſiſtants. Firſt, It differs from the Writs to Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To Dukes and Marqueſſes, the Writ is directed <hi>Praechariſſimo Conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,</hi> to Earls and Viſcounts, <hi>Chariſſimo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguineo,</hi> to Barons, <hi>Praedilecto &amp; fideli;</hi> and to Aſſiſtants only <hi>dilecto &amp; fideli,</hi> but this Writ is directed as to a Baron, <hi>viz. Predilecto &amp; perquam fideli,</hi> yet the body of the Writ differs from the Barons;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65438:133"/>the word <hi>perquam</hi> is added to <hi>fideli,</hi> being in no other former Writs, but is a proper word to expreſs our <hi>Engliſh Right Truſty;</hi> and here it may not be improperly hinted, that in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, <hi>Right Truſty</hi> is placed before <hi>Well-beloved,</hi> but in <hi>Latine Well-beloved,</hi> (or <hi>Praedilecto</hi>) is before <hi>Right Truſty,</hi> or <hi>Perquam Fideli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The words <hi>Sub fide &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantia,</hi> are in the Lords Writs next to <hi>Vobis Mandamus,</hi> but in all the Aſſiſting Writs, thoſe words are omitted; probably becauſe in former times, the Aſſiſtants had not Tenures, but only knowledge of the Laws which occaſioned them to be ſent for by Writ <hi>Pro Concilio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The words <hi>(Conſideratis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum negotiorum arduitate &amp; periculis imminentibus ceſſante excuſatione quacun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que)</hi> in the Lords Writs) are left out in the Aſſiſtants Writs, and inſtead thereof, <hi>(omnibus aliis praetermiſſis)</hi> are inſerted. In the Mandatory part of the Writ, the words in the Writ are <hi>(ac cum caeteris de Concilio noſtro)</hi> inſtead of <hi>(ac cum Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natibus praedictis)</hi> which is the chief diſtinction between the Peers and the Aſſiſtants.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In this part alſo of the Writ, the Words are only in ſhort, <hi>&amp; hoc nulla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65438:133"/>omittatis,</hi> but in the Lords Writs, <hi>(&amp; hoc ſicut nos &amp; honorem noſtrum ac Salvationem regni &amp; Eccleſiae praedictae expeditionemque dictorum negotiorum dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitis)</hi> their Lordſhips being more eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in the Kingdoms Intereſts.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In all the <hi>Pawns</hi> extant, and in moſt of the Clauſe-Rolls, (after the Exemplar Writ of every Degree or Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is named,) theſe words are added, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilia dirigenda;</hi> but there is no Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar directed to this Writ, and although the Maſter of the Rolls is an Officer very little differing in many things from the Office of the Chancellor or Keeper, yet his Writ is made a Conſimilar to the chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench his Writ, and not to the Lord Chancellor; the Lord Chancellor ſtanding Exemplar without any Conſimilar, (and there are but Two of the ſame nature in all the <hi>Pawns,</hi> from the 36. of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eighth to this time, <hi>viz.</hi> That to <hi>Cheſter</hi> and to <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> as will be ſhewn in their order) the true reaſons thereof are (as I conceive;)</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1ſt.</hi> That this Officer is of ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a nature, that a Conſimilar there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto were improper, becauſe the Original Warrant for iſſuing out Writs (as is before recited) is made from the King only to the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65438:134"/>the like Warrant not to any others of the Aſſiſting Degrees.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> His Lordſhip uſually, and in moſt Caſes, is neceſſarily the chief Miniſter of of State.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> He is the Supream Aſſiſtant of all the Aſſiſtants in the Houſe of Lords; for he is not only Lord Chancellor and Aſſiſtant, but of late years conſtantly Speaker of that Houſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4thly.</hi> His Grandeur is ſuch that he hath four places in the Lords Houſe, one behind the King of <hi>Scots-Chair,</hi> the other next to the Dukes of the <hi>Blood,</hi> the third on the firſt <hi>Woolſack, 4thly.</hi> at the Table (as will be ſhewn) whereas each of the other Aſſiſtants have but one ſingle place, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe provided for the fixt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility (as will be ſhewn in the Local part.)</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I cannot conclude this Chapter better, than from Sir <hi>John Davy</hi> (an Eminent Lawyer, in his Epiſtle to his <hi>Excellent Reports</hi>) who Deſcribes a Chancellor in theſe words, Saith he, <hi>Is he not</hi> ad Latus Principis, <hi>to attend him?</hi> Auricularius Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipis, <hi>to adviſe him? Doth not the King make him the Conduit of his Wiſdom, when he uſeth his Voice, and Tongue to declare his Royal pleaſure? Doth he not make him the</hi> Organ <hi>of his goodneſs, when he truſteth
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65438:134"/>him with his Mercy, and Conſcience in ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the bitter waters of</hi> ſummum jus, <hi>and in mitigating the rigour of Law to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Doth he not repreſent</hi> Reverentiam Principis <hi>in the Power and Authority of his Office? In a word, if the greateſt honours do belong to the greateſt vertues (for what is honour but a reflection and reward of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues) How vertuous a perſon muſt he be, with what Gifts and Graces, with what Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, with what Ornaments, both of Art and Nature muſt he be indowed and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht?</hi> viz. <hi>with all Learning, Law, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Morality, and eſpecially Eloquence to impart and Communicate all the reſt: he muſt withall have a long, and univerſal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in all the Affairs of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; he muſt be acceptable and abſolute in all points of Gravity, Conſtancy, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Temperance, Courage, Juſtice, Piety, Integrity, and all other vertues fit for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy and Government; yet ſo as the ſame be ſeaſoned with Affability, Gentleneſs, Humanity, Courteſie, without deſcending or diminiſhing himſelf, but ſtill retaining his Dignity, State, and Honour. Briefly, he muſt be a perſon of ſuch vertue and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs (that not only his Writ may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar to other Aſſiſtants) but his Life, and Converſation a Mirrour, and Example to all Magiſtrates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:65438:135"/>
                  <p n="7">7. He performs all matters which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to a Speaker of that Houſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be ſaid to be the Eye, Ear and Tongue of that great Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. He is the Inlarger, Explainer, Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Pronouncer of the Kings Commands or Pleaſure; and that which is further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, of 72. Officers under his Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more than 44. of them are imployed in Parliament concerns; either upon its Summoning, or during its Sitting; (as will be ſhewn in my Annotations) And as his Warrant is the ſecond Warrant that gives life to a Parliament, and vivacity to its continuance by Seſſions and Receſſes; ſo he gives the ſecond <hi>Fiat</hi> to its Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he hath alſo an appartment near the Lords Houſe (as will be ſhewn) for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to retire to, and for his Serjeant at Arms and others of his Attendants.</p>
                  <p>Thus having conſidered the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Lord Chancellors Writs, I muſt obſerve how exquiſitely and harmoniouſly theſe two Degrees are interpos'd; (both in their ſitting in the Lords Houſe, and in the method of their Writs in <hi>Pawns,</hi> and in the <hi>Act of Precedency</hi>) being placed in all of them between the firſt and ſecond Rank of the Lords Temporal: (as it were) to ſhew that the Lords Temporal are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to embrace and maintain Religion
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65438:135"/>and Equity, as the two chief Supporters of a Parliament.</p>
                  <p>I have ſpoken of the firſt Supporters to Religion and Equity, <hi>viz.</hi> Princes of the Bloud: and now I ſhall ſpeak of the other Supporters, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Nobles not of the Bloud, diſtinctly five Titles, <hi>viz.</hi> Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, and Barons) but more eſpecially of their Writs which Summon them to ſit in Parliament, which will guide me into ſeveral obſervations.</p>

                  <p>13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Thomae Comiti Southampton,</hi> for this Parliament, (Sir <hi>Edward Hyde</hi> being then Lord Chancellor, and had his diſtinct Writ) this Earl was Grandchild to that <hi>Wriotheſlly</hi> mentioned in the 36. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and died without Iſſue <hi>Anno.</hi> 166—</p>
                  <p>So from the 36. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. to this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of the 13. of <hi>Car.</hi> 2. there were three Exemplars, to Three Barons, (Two of them being Chancellors, and one Lord Keeper) and to Two Marqueſſes, to one Duke, and to one Earl; (and all theſe not of the Blood) Now as to the three Barons having Exemplars, (which Degree had not any before the 36. <hi>H.</hi> 8.) it may be preſumed that the Exemplars were given them in relation to their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper, or Preſident of the Kings Council.</p>
                  <p>And as to the two Marqueſſes having Exemplars, (who had not any till the 6. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.) one was as he was Treaſurer, and the other in the 15. of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. only as Marqueſs, becauſe there was no Duke Summon'd to that Parliament; (and Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> was then Lord Keeper, and <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> Lord Treaſurer, and both had diſtinct Writs;) ſo there was none of the three great Officers of State remaining to be Exemplars, except <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> then Lord Privy-Seal,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65438:139"/>who according to the fore-mentioned <hi>Act of Precedency</hi> is placed in the Lords Houſe before all Dukes, Marqueſſes, &amp;c. (not of the Blood) but I ſuppoſe, becauſe there was no Preſident wherein the Lord Privy-Seal had been Exemplar ſince its firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in the 11. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. and being not called Lord Privy-Seal, nor that place in the Lords Houſe allotted to him, till the 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. poſſibly for thoſe reaſons it was not given to the Lord Privy-Seal, but to the Marqueſs ſingly, or elſe it was an omiſſion in not minding the <hi>Act of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe latter Writs from the 36. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. did ſeem to break the method of the former; for before that <hi>Pawn</hi> of that year, no Dukes or Marqueſſes were made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilars, where an Earl was made Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar; but in the Exemplar of the 36. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Wriotheſly</hi> Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi> was made Exemplar, and the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> then Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> (and <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> the Great Maſter of the Kings Houſhold, and Preſident of the Council, were (beſides the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and Thirteen Earls, and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight Barons) made his Conſimilars, ſo as the precedency of his Exemplarity muſt be aſcribed to his Chancellorſhip, which according to the <hi>Act of Precedency</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:65438:139"/>was to be before all Dukes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (not of the Blood;) and upon the ſame reaſon, <hi>Pawlet</hi> Lord <hi>St. John</hi> in the firſt <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. being then Lord Keeper, had the Exemplar Writ, and the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> (though the Kings Uncle) Governor of the Kings Perſon, and Protector of <hi>England,</hi> (as alſo the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and Thirteen Earls and Thirty Barons) were his Conſimilars, which is the only Preſident (which I know of) where the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper had the Exemplar to a Duke of the Bloud; and upon the like reaſon, as (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the 6 of <hi>Ed.</hi> the 6. <hi>William</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> being Lord Treaſurer, (the next in Precedency to the Lord Chancellor, by the Act of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8.) had the Exemplar to two Dukes, one Marqueſs, Fourteen Earls, One Viſcount, and Thirty one Barons, all which were his Conſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: and it is probable the reaſon why this Exemplar was given to the Treaſurer and not to the Chancellor, was, becauſe <hi>Thomas Goodrick</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> was then Lord Chancellor; and ſo it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for that Biſhop to be Exemplar, for the reaſons before alledged.</p>
                  <p>Now in the firſt <hi>Car. primi, Thomas Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry</hi> being Lord Keeper, and having a diſtinct Writ, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:65438:140"/>had the Exemplar, who had one Marqueſs, Thirty ſeven Earls, Eleven Viſcounts, and Fourty ſeven Barons to his Conſimilars.</p>
                  <p>Alſo in the 15. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> (Son to the former Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>) was made Exemplar, (Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> being Lord Keeper, who had a diſtinct Writ, (and <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> being in <hi>Scotland</hi>) but he had no Duke or other Marqueſs, but Fifty eight Earls, Five Viſcounts, and Forty four Barons his Conſimilars, and ſo reduced the proper Conſimilars to its former method.</p>
                  <p>But the 14. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Thomas Wriotheſly</hi> Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi> Lord Treaſurer (Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child to the former Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi>) altered it again: (there being now alſo a diſtinct Writ to Sir <hi>Edward Hyde</hi> Lord Chancellor) for this Earl had three Dukes, (one being General) Four Marqueſſes, Fifty five Earls, Eight Viſcounts, and Sixty eight Barons his Conſimilars; (I conceive as Lord Treaſurer) for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ancient Practice, (as I have ſhewn) an Earl had not any Dukes entred as his Conſimilars.</p>
                  <p>The number of all the Exemplar Writs extant, from the 15. of <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> in <hi>An.</hi> 1322. to the 13. of <hi>Car. 2di. An.</hi> 1661. are but Twenty, and but Fourteen Kings from whom they were granted; The

                  <p>As concerning the years when theſe Exemplars were firſt iſſued to the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive degrees of Nobles before mentioned, they are in this order of time.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>37 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. The firſt Exemplar Writ to a Duke of the Blood was not till this year, though the firſt Duke in <hi>England</hi> (diſtinct from that of Earl, (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſaith) was the Eleventh of <hi>Edw. 3d.</hi> and then <hi>Edward</hi> the Kings Eldeſt Son was in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament created Duke of <hi>Cornwall;</hi> (yet <hi>Speed</hi> in his Chronicle of <hi>Edw. 3d.</hi> makes this Creation in the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>Edw. 3d.</hi> when (ſaith he) he was created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> which agrees with the Records of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and therefore I conceive there is ſome miſtake in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>) but however the miſtake
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65438:141"/>be, the firſt Exemplar Writ to a Duke was not till this year; for though <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was Duke in the Third or Eleventh year of his Father, and <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Norfolk</hi> ſoon after was created Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> ſoon after created Duke of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> yet they had not any Exemplar Writs as Dukes, but before as Earls; ſo as <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> in this Parliament of the 37. <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> was the firſt Duke which had an Exemplar Writ.</p>
                  <p>47 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. As I have ſhewn the firſt Exemplar to an Earl of the Bloud, ſo this ſhews the firſt Exemplar to an Earl not of the Bloud, which was this year to <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel;</hi> for though there were many Earls before not of the Bloud, yet they had only Conſimilar Writs, but no Exemplars extant to any of them till this Year.</p>
                  <p>28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. And though there were many Dukes not of the Blood ſince the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Title, yet the firſt Duke not of the Blood who was thought fit to be an Exemplar, was not till this Parliament, and the Predeceſſor of this Duke was an Earl in <hi>Edw. 3ds.</hi> time, and even this Duke was Earl in the time of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, before any Duke was created.</p>
                  <p>6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. Though the firſt Marqueſs
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65438:141"/>(created in <hi>England</hi>) was in the <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>Rich. 2d.</hi> yet none were thought fit to be Exemplars, till this 6. of <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> that <hi>William</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> was made the firſt Exemplar in Parliament of that Dignity, but his Exemplar had the additional Title of Lord Treaſurer, who is the ſecond Officer of State.</p>
                  <p>36 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Although a Baron is a more ancient Title with us in <hi>England,</hi> than any of the other Degrees of the Nobles, yet we find no Record now extant, wherein a Baron, ſingly as Baron, had the Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar Writ; for (as I ſaid) <hi>Thomas Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otheſly</hi> Baron of <hi>Tichfield</hi> being Chancellor, <hi>William Pawlet</hi> Baron of <hi>Bazing</hi> being Lord Keeper, were Exemplars in thoſe Parliaments, and had Conſimilars appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; but <hi>Edward Hyde</hi> Baron of <hi>Hindon</hi> having a diſtinct Aſſiſting Writ, had no Conſimilar allotted him, either in reſpect of his Barony or Aſſiſtancy.</p>
                  <p>Thus we find that Earls, Dukes, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes and Barons have been Exemplars, but we do not find any Viſcounts to be ſo in any Parliament ſince the creation of that Dignity, which was (as I ſaid) in <hi>Hen. 6ths.</hi> time to <hi>John de Beaumont.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe the word <hi>Vicecomes</hi> doth imply a Conſimilar to <hi>Comes,</hi> ſo it were improper for <hi>Comites</hi> to be Conſimilars to a <hi>Vicecomiti.</hi>

                  <p>Concerning the additionals of the Titles to thoſe Nobles mentioned in their Exemplars, it may be obſerved, That in all thoſe Writs to <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>8ths.</hi> time, the words <hi>Conſanguineo Chariſſimo Praedilecto Dilecto &amp; Fideli,</hi> were not ſo poſitively ſixt to the ſeveral Degrees in their Writs, but ſince that time they have paſt in a more conſtant method, <hi>viz.</hi> to Dukes and Marqueſſes, <hi>Praechariſſimo Conſanguineo;</hi> to Earls and Viſcounts, <hi>Chariſſimo Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineo;</hi> to Barons, <hi>Praedilecto &amp; Fideli;</hi> and to the Lord Chancellor as chief Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant, <hi>Praedilecto &amp; perquam Fideli;</hi> but to all the other Aſſiſtants, of which I ſhall ſpeak more, only <hi>Dilecto &amp; Fideli.</hi>

                  <p>Though the Title of <hi>Baro</hi> for <hi>Baron</hi> is not us'd in theſe Parliament Writs, no more is <hi>Bannerettus</hi> or <hi>Banneret;</hi> yet it is

                     <hi>Accordingly the Parliament did ſit the</hi> 3d. <hi>of</hi> March, <hi>and</hi> Thomas Camois <hi>in the Lords Houſe: but that which Mr.</hi> Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>obſerves in this Writ is, that this is not to be underſtood of any other</hi> Banneret <hi>than a Parliament</hi> Baron, <hi>or a</hi> Banneret <hi>of that time. The expreſſing of</hi> hujuſmodi Bannoretti <hi>ſhews, that it is not meant of all</hi> Bannerets, <hi>but ſuch only as have the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, either by inheritance, or in ſuch a kind, that an inheritance might be of it, which is apparent alſo by the precedent words in the Writ;</hi> Bannerettus eſt ſicut quam plures Anteceſſorum ſuorum extiterint, <hi>for it was never conceived, that the Title of</hi> Banne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret <hi>as it denotes a</hi> Knight-Banneret <hi>was ever hereditary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, another Knight for <hi>Surry</hi> was Choſen; and this <hi>Thomas Camois</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord <hi>Thomas Camois,</hi> did ſit that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the Lords Houſe, as his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had done; for I find, that in the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Ed. 2d,</hi> and <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>Ed. 3d. Radulphus Camois</hi> was Summon'd by Writs, and did ſit in thoſe two Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but I find none in 54 years after, <hi>viz.</hi> till the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>Rich. 2d.</hi> and then that name continued in 37 ſucceſſive Parliaments, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. as may be ſeen in the Records. I ſhall make no further uſe of this Writ here, than
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65438:146"/>that of the words, <hi>Thomas Camois Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier qui eſt Bannerettus,</hi> doe make it clear, that <hi>Banneret</hi> was denoted by the word <hi>Chevalier,</hi> and that that word <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi> amongſt the Lords did ſhew the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Banneret</hi> and an Ancient or Hereditary <hi>Baron.</hi> Now in reſpect it is evident that the Title of <hi>Banneret</hi> was firſt brought into uſe for ſome meritorious action, in bearing, preſerving, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the Kings <hi>Banner</hi> in time of War; whereupon he received the honour of Knight <hi>Banneret,</hi> and thereupon as an additional honour was alſo thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſit amongſt the hereditary <hi>Barons;</hi> and in reſpect many Martial exploits were about that time done in <hi>France</hi> (the word <hi>Chevalier</hi> being borrowed from the <hi>French Tongue</hi>) came into ſo great repute, that ſuch as did merit it, did juſtly Challenge it, and thoſe of leſs merit did Covet it, and by meer intereſt and favour obtain'd it, and ſo by degrees (as I have formerly ſhewn the word <hi>Chevalier</hi> upon the account of merit or favour, did ſwallow up the other Titles; and in proceſs of time, and favour of Kings, it grew to be fixt and hereditary, which was intended at firſt but Titulary and Temporary, which hath been the fate of moſt of our Titles of Honour.</p>

I ſhall proceed to the <hi>Brevia aperta</hi> or open Writs, commonly called Patents, by which (ſuch as are Created) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to ſit there; yet even thoſe Lords, which by their Creations are ſo priviledg'd, have alſo Cloſe Writs of Summons ſent them <hi>pro forma,</hi> leſt they ſhould fail of their duties for want of intimation, and the Writ is and hath been anciently Clos'd, leaſt (as I conceive) the Writ ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch private matter, or cauſes of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons as are not fit to be known by the conveyor of them to their Lordſhips.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Theſe Lords Patentees having Writs of Summons, as Memoirs of their Duty to the publick, their Patents do not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile them to ſit in Parliament, but direct them where they ſhall ſit, which their Writs of Summons do not expreſs; for the Writs do only appoint a place, and time where and when to meet, but not their diſtinct places where to ſit, both in reſpect to their own, and to the other degrees of Nobility.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe are called Patents of Creation, ſignifying ſomething which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; now it is evident by what I have ſhewn, that there were perſons called <hi>Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts,</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi> both in Foreign parts, and in this Kingdom, long before thoſe Degrees were Erected by Patent; but till then (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſaith) they were to be eſteemed
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65438:148"/>rather Official than Nobilitated Dignities, and therefore it muſt be underſtood that the Form of making them <hi>Earls, Dukes, &amp;c.</hi> by theſe Letters Patents, were not in uſe here in <hi>England,</hi> till <hi>Dukes, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes, Earls, &amp;c.</hi> did accept of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument or Form; and thereupon call'd <hi>Dukes, Earls, &amp;c.</hi> by Creation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I find theſe Patents to be of three ſorts. Firſt, of Titles Confirm'd (<hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as were before their Patents.) Secondly, of Titles Reviv'd (<hi>viz.</hi> which were before, but were extinct for want of Iſſue, or Eſcheated to the Crown for Treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which often happened in the Barons-wars, and at other times Thirdly, Titles Created or given where none was before. As to the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> of ſuch Titles as were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Patents of Creation, it appears that <hi>Awbry de Vere</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> ſaith) had the choice of four Earldoms, <hi>viz.

               <p>The like Patent of meer Creation was that of the Ninth of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, when <hi>Robert de Vere,</hi> then <hi>Earl of Oxford,</hi> was Created <hi>Marqueſs of Dublin;</hi> (which, ſaith Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> was in him an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Title:) however, it was the firſt that any was Created of that Title here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And alſo the like Patent of meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was that of 18 <hi>H.</hi> 6. whereby <hi>John de Beaumount</hi> was created <hi>Viſcount de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,</hi> the Title of <hi>Viſcount</hi> being before an Official Dignity, but never till this Creation nobilitated. All which may be more fully ſeen in the <hi>Rolls Chappel,</hi> or <hi>Patent Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. As I have ſhewn three ſorts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Creation, ſo, for the clearing of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65438:153"/>ſome ſubſequent matters, I muſt ſhew, That theſe Patents uſually conſiſted of four parts, (yet ſubject to variations) Firſt, <hi>The King's Stile and Preamble.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Of Inveſtitures.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Of Places in Parliament.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Grants of Lands, Annuities,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As to the Preambles upon New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Revivals, they were uſually long, expreſſing the Merits of the Perſon, but commonly they were couch'd in few words; and thoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in generals, <hi>Pro bono &amp; laudabili ſervitio quod dilectus &amp; fidelis noſter</hi> A. B. <hi>nobis nuper impendit,</hi> &amp;c. particularly <hi>Pro rebelles noſtros debellando,</hi> (according to the particular Services) and in others, <hi>Progratia noſtra ſpeciali &amp; certa ſcientia &amp; mero motu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Second I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak of them in the Chapter of <hi>Inveſtitures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Fourth, concerning <hi>Grants, Annuities,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall have little uſe of them.</p>
               <p>But for the Third, concerning <hi>The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Places of the Degrees of Nobles,</hi> I can find nothing in ancient Patents, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, <hi>viz.</hi> That his place ſhould be in <hi>loco quem teneri poterit in futurum in noſtris Conſilijs &amp; Parliamentis;</hi> and ſo they were generally ſet down (except in ſuch as I
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65438:154"/>ſhall mention) till <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time (which was ſoon after that the Act of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. concerning <hi>Precedencies</hi> was made) and then the whole frame of the Patents for all the Degrees, from the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend'</hi> or <hi>Sciatis,</hi> were ſetled in this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Method, and have ever ſince ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with very little alterations.

                     <p>There is nothing alledged for the length of theſe Patents, but that the latter Ages (as 'tis ſaid) are more cautious than the former, and that <hi>abundans cautela</hi> (ſay we) <hi>non nocet,</hi> which occaſions an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of words more than anciently were in uſe.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſinalneſs of the <hi>Creation-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> thoſe who have taken pains in Writing about raiſing of the price of Money, both <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> ſince <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time, tell us, That there are three ways of raiſing it; Firſt, By <hi>encreaſing the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi> of it, that is by giving more parts to it than originally it had, as by ordaining an Angel of <hi>Gold</hi> to be valued at a 11 <abbr>
                           <hi>s.</hi>
                        </abbr> which was Coin'd for 10 <abbr>
                           <hi>s.</hi>
                        </abbr> or a Shilling, to be valued at 14 <abbr>
                           <hi>d.</hi>
                        </abbr> The Second, By <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the Matter,</hi> but leaving the ſame Name and Value to the Money which it had before, as when Angels or Shillings are Coin'd by the ſame Name and Value as before, but diminiſhed ſome Grains in the weight; or if new Names be given to them, and the ſame Value retain'd, but the weight diminiſhed, for in this caſe there being really leſs Gold or Silver in weight in the price than was before, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue remaining the ſame, this Silver and Gold which remains hath an high price ſet upon it. The Third is, When the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65438:159"/>remaining the ſame, of the Species of Money, and the Weight the ſame, the fineneſs is abated by putting more Allay to it, ſo as really then there is leſs Gold or Silver in fineneſs (for it is ſupply'd by Copper (which is uſually the Allay to either) whereby the Weight is made the ſame as before, but the Fineneſs ſo much leſs. They further tell us, That the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe Allays, are firſt the Gain which the <hi>States</hi> make by it, the better to ſupply themſelves in their neceſſities for Money; the other Cauſe is an Art which all States do frequently uſe (as it were) to rob one another of their Money, <hi>by vying</hi> one upon another, who ſhall raiſe their Money higheſt; and this occaſions the raiſe and fall of Exchanges of Money among our Merchants, which is a Myſtery worth the knowing, by every one that ſerves in Parliament, thereby to prevent Injuries, and to maintain the Honour and Profit of our Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>But whatever uncertainties are in the raiſe or fall of Money, this is certain, That 20 <hi>
                           <abbr>l.</abbr> per Annum,</hi> in thoſe days, did go as far (if not farther) in managing Mens occaſions (where Money was to be us'd) as 200 <hi>
                           <abbr>l.</abbr> per Annum</hi> now; and one great Reaſon was, Becauſe in almoſt all matters of Wars or Peace, the Tenants
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65438:159"/>were obliged by their Tenures, to ſupply their Lords, eſpecially in Proviſions for Hoſpitality and Labour, without Wages, or very little, ſo as a little Money was lookt on as a great Reward, as may be ſeen in the Tenure of the Lord of the Mannor of <hi>Carlton</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who is oblig'd every year, with himſelf and his Servants, to preſent to the King a certain number of Herrings from the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> (with which the Town of <hi>Tarmouth</hi> are oblig'd by their Patent to ſupply that City for that purpoſe) and after three days ſtay, upon delivery of the Herrings to the King, the Lord of <hi>Carlton</hi> is to be preſented by the Maſter of the Green-Cloth with a Groat, to buy him a pair of Gloves, as a full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of his Trouble, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to this day.</p>
                     <p>So as if we look upon the gift of 20 <hi>Mark,</hi> or 20 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> according to the preſent Adequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Money, to the rates of other things, it may ſeem a Sum derogatory to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the King that gives it, as to him that receives it, and therefore it muſt be conſidered as the Groat, a Gift of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Noble and Liberal in its firſt Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but had the large <hi>Encomium</hi> to it (before recited) been as ancient as the Gift, I ſhould not at this time have taken notice of its exuberancy. However (in

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of Nobles, Lords, and Peers.</head>
               <p>I Have paſt through the four firſt Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar Writs in the <hi>Pawn,</hi> concerning the Lords Spiritual and Lords Temporal, and given an account alſo of ſo much of their Patents of Creations as relate to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But in reſpect theſe Nobles are ſometimes call'd Lords, and ſometimes Peers, and thereupon the very place where they ſit in their High Judicatory is call'd the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> or <hi>Houſe of Peers.</hi> I think fit to hint ſome few Memorials be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed to the Fifth Exemplar of <hi>Aſſiſtant Writs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is agreed by all Inſpectors of Words, that Lords and Peers are of the ſame ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification with us, that <hi>Domini</hi> and <hi>Pares</hi> had with the old <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo as we and the <hi>French</hi> are equally beholding to the <hi>Latin</hi> for them: but when the word <hi>Dominus</hi> was chang'd into the word Lord, (having no more affinity of ſound or Orthography than <hi>Comes</hi> and Earl) or when <hi>Pares</hi> into <hi>Proceres</hi> (of a nearer ſound) may be a queſtion, but it may be ſufficiently evident, that the word Lord was the Abbreviation
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65438:161"/>of <hi>Louerd,</hi> which the <hi>Saxons</hi> at their firſt coming, about the year 448. uſed here inſtead of <hi>Dominus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the word <hi>Peer,</hi> we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe it as ſignifying a Defence, as <hi>Dover</hi>-Peer and <hi>Yarmouth</hi>-Peer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is from <hi>Petra,</hi> a <hi>Rock,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> write <hi>Pierre,</hi> and we <hi>Peer,</hi> theſe Artificial Peers being made in imitation of Rocks, to defend the Land againſt Inundations, and it may very aptly allude to the Noble Peers in Parliament, who are the Rocks or Peers of our Safety.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To paſs this, it is allow'd, That <hi>Pares</hi> in <hi>Latin, Paires</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Peers</hi> in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dialect, are all three words of the ſame ſence, ſignifying <hi>Parity</hi> or <hi>Equality,</hi> and as the <hi>French</hi> had it from the <hi>Romans,</hi> by whom they were call'd <hi>Pares Curiae,</hi> viz. <hi>Qui ab eodem domino feudum retinent,</hi> ſo we had it from the <hi>French,</hi> who in the year 778. when <hi>Charles</hi> the Great (being then King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſoon after Emperour of the <hi>Weſt</hi>) did put all the Government of <hi>France</hi> into the hands of Twelve of the moſt eminent Nobles, who thereupon were call'd by the Title of the <hi>Twelve Peers of France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pares Gubernatores Franciae,</hi> or in their Language <hi>Paires d'France,</hi> whereof ſix were Lords Spiritual, <hi>viz.</hi> the Archbiſhop
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65438:161"/>of <hi>Reims,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Laon</hi> and <hi>Langres,</hi> (who alſo were ſtil'd Dukes) the Biſhops of <hi>Beauvois, Chalois</hi> and <hi>Nôyon,</hi> which three latter were alſo ſtil'd <hi>Comtes</hi> or Earls, and ſix were Lords Temporal, <hi>viz.</hi> the Duke of <hi>Burgundy, Normandy,</hi> and <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Flanders, Champaigne,</hi> and <hi>Tholoſe;</hi> the ſix Eccleſiaſticks do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to this day, but the Territories of the other ſix being either united to, or alienated from the Crown, do now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of ſuch Princes of the Blood or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorits (without limitation by number of ſix) as the King thinks fit; but thoſe who are, do injoy the Privileges of the Original Peers conſtituted by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From this Conſtitution it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we in <hi>England,</hi> (upon the <hi>Normans</hi> coming) did make uſe of ſomething of that method, and did then alſo firſt make uſe of the word Peers, although in truth, as I ſaid, both of us had it from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> we alſo made uſe of their number Twelve, as may be obſerved in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Parliamentary Degrees, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt Archbiſhops, ſecondly Biſhops, thirdly Archdeacons, fourthly Deans of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, fifthly Proctors of Chapters, and ſixthly Proctors of the Clergy; and ſix alſo are of the Temporal Degrees, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:65438:162"/>firſt Princes of the Blood, ſecondly Dukes not of the Blood, thirdly Marqueſſes, fourthly Earls, fifthly Viſcounts, and ſixthly Barons. Theſe being ſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd into twelve Degrees, but not into twelve Perſons, I ſhall paſs to what others have ſpoken concerning the number of our Peers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In reſpect the Peers of <hi>France</hi> were anciently confin'd to a certain number of ſix and ſix, ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers would alſo confine ours to a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſome to five and ſome to fifty. But herein we may truſt that learned <hi>Selden,</hi> who ſaith, That <hi>the number of Peers with us, was never confined to any more certainty than the Lords of the Parliament are; for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whereas only the number of five Peers are mentioned in ſome Records, that can be no Rule of certainty; becauſe at this day the number Five doth legally expreſs Seven; (as it doth in the Parliament Writ to the Warden of the Cingqueports or five Ports; There being in truth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Seven of them, and ſo conſequently return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> whereas there are eight Ports called <hi>Cinqueports,</hi> and ſo returned; (as will be ſhewn in the ſecond Part) but however the miſtake be in that <hi>Grave Author,</hi> yet with ſubmiſſion to his great Learning, I conceive this might have been better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd:
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65438:162"/>for the old Writers who mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five, might intend the five Degrees of Nobility under the Princes of the Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts and Barons, which makes the compleat Temporal Degrees in Parliaments.</p>
               <p>And what others write of Fifty, that number without doubt did relate to the number of which thoſe five Degrees did in thoſe days conſiſt; which were now increaſt to Eighty eight, (as may be ſeen in this <hi>Pawn</hi>) beſides thoſe of the Blood Royal, and the Lords Spiritual, and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and have varied in number almoſt in every Kings Reign. But I rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there was ſome miſtake in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of this number Five, by applying it <hi>Perſonally</hi> and not <hi>Virtually;</hi> for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, and even to this day, the number five, that is five Lords, do with that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Conſtitute the Houſe of Lords for the diſpatch of leſſer Affairs, till a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber come, fit for greater Affairs; and ſo the number of fourty Members, whether Knights, Citizens, or Burgeſſes, or ſome of either, do Conſtitute an Houſe of Commons, yet theſe alſo do not proceed to weightier matters, till they be ſupplied with a greater number; ſo as the number five may be well thought to have its rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Houſe of Lords, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65438:163"/>of fifty to the Houſe of Commons.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But not to inſiſt further about the definite number of Lords or Peers, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the derivation of the words Lords and Peers; I ſhall give a touch of the words <hi>Praelati, Magnates</hi> and <hi>Proceres</hi> us'd in the <hi>Latin</hi> Writs and Patents; and herein, if we conſider the firſt Inſtitution of this Houſe, it did and ſtill doth conſiſt of Lords Spiritual and Lords Temporal, (diverſified into ſeveral Degrees) as Archbiſhops, Dukes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the Lords Spiritual were known only by the Title <hi>Archiepiſcopi &amp; Epiſcopi, i. e.</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Biſhops; and the Temporal only by the Titles of <hi>Comites</hi> and <hi>Barones, i. e.</hi> Earls and Barons; in general terms the Lords Spiritual were called <hi>Praelati, i. e.</hi> Prelates; (in relation to matters which concern the Soul, which hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or prelation to that of the Body) and the Lords Temporal were called in general <hi>Magnates &amp; Proceres, i. e.</hi> Lords and Peers, (intimating Perſons of the greateſt Power and Domination) and being the chiefeſt Peers and Supports (as I ſaid) of the King and Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time, certain Perſons called Abbots and Priors, (who were the Fathers, Heads and chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Monaſteries, or of ſuch Houſes as
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65438:163"/>were poſſeſs'd by Monks and Canons living in thoſe Houſes, with an intent or pretence of weaning themſelves from the World, and diſpoſing their minds to a contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life) and theſe being of a mixt nature, partly Regular and partly Secular, and (in reſpect of their great acceſs of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories given by the charity of others to ſupport them) Baronial did ſtep in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lords Spiritual and the Lords Temporal, and ſo were called <hi>Praelati</hi> with the Biſhops, and <hi>Magnates &amp; Proceres</hi> with the Lords Temporal. But <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eighth (as I have ſhewn) did diſſolve them, ſo that the Biſhops have ow the ſingle Title of <hi>Praelati;</hi> and the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lords, of <hi>Magnates &amp; Proceres,</hi> for we ſee in the Summoning of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (when Biſhops were excluded, the words <hi>Cum Praelatis</hi> was left out, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored, then they were equally Summon'd to ſit, <hi>inter Praelatos, Magnates &amp; Proceres,</hi> and the prepoſition <hi>Inter,</hi> is properly inſerted; for however their ſitting is, yet the Biſhops are called over, between Viſcounts and Barons.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Now as Abbots and Priors were thus interpoſed in <hi>Henry</hi> the Thirds time; ſo in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> the Third (as I have ſhewn) Dukes began, and as they increaſed, did ſtep in before Earls and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:65438:164"/>Barons; and in <hi>Rich.</hi> the Seconds time Marqueſſes began, and as they increaſt alſo ſtept in between Dukes and Earls; and in <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>6ths.</hi> time Viſcounts began, and as they increaſt did ſtep in between Earls and Barons; ſo as Originally, according to the dates of their Admiſſions, theſe Lords Spiritual and Temporal were all Peers, <hi>i. e. Pares, pari gradu,</hi> the Biſhops were <hi>Pares inter ſeipſos pari gradu Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copali,</hi> (the Abbots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their time, were <hi>Pares inter ſeipſos,</hi> and both of thoſe Degrees were alſo <hi>Pares</hi> upon a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronial account; (ſo the Dukes and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes being Earls or Barons before they were created Dukes or Marqueſſes, in reſpect of their Earldoms or Baronies were Peers to the Earls and Barons; and the Viſcounts alſo, (moſt of them being Barons before they were created Viſcounts) in reſpect of their Baronies were Peers alſo to the Barons; ſo alſo upon a Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial account they were <hi>Pares pari gradu Baroniali:</hi> Till Patents of Creation did more exactly diſtinguiſh them, without relation to Baronies; ſo as now to ſpeak properly, each Degree are <hi>Pares</hi> or <hi>Prees</hi> to their diſtinct Degrees.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I muſt here again make uſe of my former obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the Writs to Dukes they were Summon'd to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65438:164"/>in Parliament, <hi>Cum Magnatibus &amp; Proceribus;</hi> and ſo are the Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts and Barons, yet the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents to the Dukes do place them <hi>inter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceres &amp; Magnates,</hi> putting <hi>Proceres</hi> or <hi>Peers</hi> before <hi>Magnates</hi> or Lords; and in the Pattents to Marqueſſes, they are placed <hi>inter alios Marchiones;</hi> and the Earls <hi>inter alios Comites;</hi> and the Viſcounts <hi>inter alios Vicecomites;</hi> and the Barons <hi>inter alios Barones.</hi> But none of the Lords Patentees (except the Dukes in relation to their places) do take any notice of the poſition of the words <hi>inter Proceres &amp; Magnates;</hi> for the Earls and Barons Patents have reference only to their own Degrees and not to the three other Degrees; ſo as <hi>Proceres</hi> or Peers is applied only to the Dukes in their Patents of Creation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This is all that I can ſatisfie my ſelf in concerning the uſe of the words Lords and Peers, <hi>Praelati, Magnates, &amp; Proceres;</hi> and that this may be the more ſatisfactory to others, I ſhall recite the words of the learned <hi>Selden,</hi> (in his Titles of Honour) whoſe laſting Credit is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond exception; (ſaith he,) <hi>Though there be a diſtinction of Degrees in our Nobility, yet in all publick actions they are Peers or Equals;</hi> (<hi>as in the Tryals of Noblemen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in which the Spiritual Lords never did
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65438:165"/>or do concern themſelves Perſonally, becauſe it is againſt their Canons to act in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which relate to Blood) yet whatever Acts paſs, theſe words are inſerted,</hi> viz. <hi>We the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with the Kings Aſſent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for though the Lords Spiritual conſiſt of Archbiſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and the Lords Temporal of Princes of the Blood, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts and Barons, yet they are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded as Peers in the words Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal,</hi> and ſo in many caſes the word Peers is alſo generally applied; ſo that, as the words Lords and Peers have been of latter times intermixedly uſed, we cannot well make a difference between them otherwiſe than is before expreſt.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That the words Lords and Peers have been uſed promiſcuouſly, in relation to the five Degrees of the Lords Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is evident from the Commiſſions iſſued for the Trials of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> 1640. the Lord <hi>Morley, Anno</hi> 1665. the Lord <hi>Cornwallis, Anno</hi> 1676. the Earl of <hi>Pembroke, Anno</hi> 1678. wherein the words are, <hi>Damus autem <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſis &amp; ſingulis Ducibus, Marchionibus, Comitibus, Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitibus &amp; Baronibus,</hi> &amp;c. (without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>Praelatis,</hi> for reaſons before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) and though the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:65438:165"/>and Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> were Earls, yet by the Commiſſion they were triable, <hi>per Barones, Viceomites, Comites Marchiones, &amp; Duces,</hi> and not by Earls only; and ſo though the Lord <hi>Morley</hi> and Lord <hi>Cornwallis</hi> were only Barons, yet they were triable by Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls and Viſcounts, and not by Barons only, whereby the word Peers ſeems to be a word of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, giving no real diſtinction to thoſe five Degrees of Nobility; ſo as all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the Temporal Lords are Peers, and the Peers Lords; to confirm this, I ſhall cite one paſſage more from Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That though we borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word Peers from the twelve Peers in</hi> France, <hi>yet here we apply it to all the Lords in Parliament, and not to any ſet number of them; becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the number of our Nobles may be more or leſs, as the King pleaſeth:</hi> and as Marqueſſes and Viſcounts were (as I ſaid) interpos'd to Dukes, Earls and Barons, ſo he may abſtract leſs, or add more, as he thinks moſt fit, for the ſupport of Nobility, for he is <hi>Dominus Nobilitatis &amp; Honoris,</hi> or the Fountain of Honour; and that this Prerogative may be more fully ſeen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in the 21. of <hi>Jacobi</hi> (it being needleſs to quote former precedents) five ſeveral Writs were iſſued after the <hi>Pawn</hi> was
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65438:166"/>ſetled; yet entred in the Margent of the <hi>Pawn</hi> for that year, to five ſeveral perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Lord <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> Sir <hi>John Sucklin,</hi> Knight, Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troler of the Kings Houſe, to Sir <hi>Thomas Edmunds,</hi> Knight, Treaſurer of the Kings Houſhold, and to Sir <hi>Richard Weſton,</hi> Knight, Chancellor of the Exchequer, to ſummon and impower them to ſit in the Lords Houſe, who otherwiſe had no right of <hi>Tenure, Preſcription</hi> or <hi>Creation.</hi> So in the firſt of <hi>Caroli primi,</hi> ſix ſeveral Writs were iſſued (and alſo entred in the Margent of the <hi>Pawn</hi> for that year) <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Oliver Lord St. John,</hi> and again to Sir <hi>Thomas Edmunds,</hi> Sir <hi>John Sucklin,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Weſton,</hi> and to Sir <hi>Robert Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Knight, one of the Kings Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and to Sir <hi>Humphry May,</hi> Chancellor of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> and ſo in 15 <hi>Car. primi,</hi> two Writs were iſſued and alſo entred in the Margent of the <hi>Pawn</hi> for that year, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Charles Viſcount Wilmot,</hi> of the Kings Privy-Council, and to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Newburgh,</hi> Knight, then Chancellor of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and alſo of the Kings Privy-Council.</p>
               <p n="12">12. To ſum up all, I apprehend, That thoſe Lords Spiritual which are ſummon'd by Writ to ſit in Parliament are Vital Peers, and the Lords Temporal ſo ſummon'd
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65438:166"/>are hereditary Peers, for there are other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords, which may be, but are not ſummon'd, and thereby are no Parliament Peers, yet are Lords, and upon an heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary account alſo; for the King (as I ſaid) can ſummon or not ſummon any of them when he thinks fit, unleſs any Lord claims a right by Patent of Creation, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and then upon that right he demands his Writ, and it is ſeldom denied, if the grounds of their demands be right, if du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious, the Caſe is debated in the Lords Houſe, as in the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaveny,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion, That the Lords Temporal are only to be accounted Peers, and not the Lords Spiritual, firſt, Becauſe they ſit there rather by their Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons than Tenures, as anciently they did; ſecondly, Their Titles of Lord is but vital at moſt; thirdly, In caſe of Treaſon or Felony committed by a Spiritual Lord or Lord Temporal, the manner of trying them upon Indictment and Judgment upon Conviction are clearly different, as will be ſhewn in the Chapter of <hi>Trial by Peers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">13. Notwithſtanding theſe Allegations, it is evident, That the Lords Spiritual are <hi>Pares</hi> or Peers, but <hi>inter ſeipſos gradu E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopali &amp; vitali,</hi> but not <hi>Pares</hi> to the

All other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Nobility, or Degrees under theſe five Degrees, are only <hi>Pares ſui cujuſ<expan>

               <p>The next ſubject that I am guided to treat of, is concerning Proxees to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, which may be made either of Lords or Peers, or of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lords nor Peers, yet by this Proxima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are, <hi>pro hac vice,</hi> nobilitated.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of Proxees.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Am now to ſpeak of ſuch as are ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Lords Spiritual or Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, to ſit in the Lords Houſe, and theſe are called by the name of <hi>Proxees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Latin</hi> word for <hi>Proxee</hi> is <hi>Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> which is ſometimes Engliſh'd <hi>Proxee,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Proctor,</hi> according to the Employment of the Perſon to whom it is apply'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proxee</hi> in a Parliamentary ſence is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly apply'd to ſuch a Deputy or Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute as is choſen by any Lord Spiritual or Lord Temporal (by Licence firſt had from the King, in caſe of juſt occaſion alledged for abſence) to ſupply his Deputy in the Lords Houſe, and thereupon his Vote to be as ſignificant to all purpoſes, as if the abſent Lord were preſent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word <hi>Proxee</hi> may well be thought to be only the <hi>Tachygraphy</hi> or ſhort wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Proxime,</hi> ſignifying the next in Judgment, Opinion, Degree, or Quality to the Lord who chooſeth him for his <hi>Proxee.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:65438:168"/>
               <p>But <hi>Proctor,</hi> which is the moſt literal abbreviation of <hi>Procurator,</hi> hath ſeveral applications, firſt to ſuch as are in ſome ſort a Limb or Branch of Parliaments, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are choſen by the Chapters and Clergy, together with Archdeacons and Deans, to repreſent the whole Clergy, as Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes do the Laity or whole Commons of <hi>England;</hi> but theſe are more uſually call'd Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, the other conſtantly Proctors, both being deputed by diſtinct Degrees to diſtinct Purpoſes, as will be more fully ſhewn.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are alſo Proctors for the two Univerſities of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Thirdly, Proctors of Eccleſiaſtical Courts, which have no other relation to Parliaments than according as they are concern'd in Elections.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proxees</hi> which are admitted to the Lords Houſe are like thoſe in the old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, call'd <hi>Procuratores Caeſaris,</hi> (which were the chief of four ſorts of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatores</hi> amongſt them) becauſe that firſt and chief of the four were only imploy'd <hi>ad Res publicas adminiſtrandas,</hi> (the other three for leſſer matters) and ſo the <hi>Proxees</hi> of the Lords Houſe being the chief of all other <hi>Proxees,</hi> are to be eſteemed <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carum
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65438:168"/>rerum adminiſtratores,</hi> as fully as the abſent Lords (except in ſome particulars as to Place, Continuance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="2">2 Theſe Noble <hi>Proxees</hi> are (as I ſaid) lincenſed by the King, upon the Petition or Requeſt of ſome Lord Spiritual or Lord Temporal, and are not uſually made of Strangers, (who are not Members of the Lords Houſe) nor of the Aſſiſtants of that Houſe.</p>
               <p>When the abſent Lords occaſions of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence have not been juſt, or his abſence inconvenient to the Publick, the King hath often deny'd to Licenſe their <hi>Proxees;</hi> but when the Allegations have been juſt, the <hi>Proxee</hi> hath been ſometimes allow'd without the Kings Licenſe.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it hath been allow'd to the abſent Lord, to make a <hi>Proxee</hi> of ſuch a perſon as is otherwiſe incapacitated to ſit in the Lords Houſe, (for by this he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated) but there hath been none ſuch allow'd in this Parliament.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Generally the abſent Lord doth ſix upon ſuch a Lord as (I ſaid) doth ſit in the Lords Houſe, by his own Right and Writ of Summons, whereby the <hi>Proxee</hi>-ſitting Lord hath a double Voice, one for himſelf, the other for the abſent Lord to whom he is <hi>Proxee.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:65438:169"/>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe Noble <hi>Proxees</hi> are made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before the ſitting of a Parliament, (after the Writs are iſſued) and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the time of their ſitting, and their Deputations both before and after the ſitting have ſeveral Forms, as will be ſhewn.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In former times the Lords Spiritual had the privilege to make two or three <hi>Proxees,</hi> but ſince the diſſolution of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, and that Abbots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were excluded, no <hi>Proxor,</hi> or abſent Lord, doth make but one <hi>Proxee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Licenſes for <hi>Proxees</hi> (as I ſaid) were granted by the King, upon the abſent Lords Petition; which Petition from <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time was in this Form:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sereniſſimo Principi Domino Edwardo Dei gratia Regi Angliae, Franciae &amp; Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berniae Domino,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Quia impedimentis varijs &amp; arduis negotijs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſumus multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter impediti quo inſtante Parliamento veſtro apud Weſtmonaſterium in Quind',</hi> &amp;c. <hi>proximo futur' perſonaliter eſſe non valentes.</hi> (And ſo others, for other reaſons) pray that he may be allow'd his <hi>Proxee;</hi> whereupon Licenſe was granted, as may be ſeen in ancient Journals, but more lately in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, thus:</p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:65438:169"/>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Right-truſty and well-beloved, We greet you well. Whereas we are inform'd, That by reaſon of Sickneſs you are not able to make repair hither to this our Parliament, to be holden at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>We have thought good, by theſe our Letters, to diſpenſe with you for your abſence, and to Licenſe you to remain ſtill at home for this time, ſo nevertheleſs that you ſend up your</hi> Proxee, <hi>of ſuch Perſonage as may be for you in your Name, to give his Voice and Aſſent, or Denial, to ſuch Matters as ſhall be concluded on in our ſaid Parliament. And this our Letter ſhall be your Warrant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Given under our Signet at our Palace at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>the</hi> 20th <hi>of</hi> November, <hi>in the Eighth Year of Our Reign.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p n="8">8. Theſe Licenſes are uſually entred in the Signet or Privy-Seal-Offices, (and paſs no further) but are certified to the Lords when ſitting.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This regular Method of Licenſes continued till about the end of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s Reign, but by the kindneſs (or connivance of her Succeſſors to the Nobles) there hath been of late no more Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny us'd than a Verbal Motion to the King; and ſome Nobles by that Indulgence have conſtituted <hi>Proxees</hi> without application
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65438:170"/>to the King, only adding in their Deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their <hi>Proxees</hi> (viz. <hi>per Licentiam Domini Noſtri Regis</hi>) conceiving that the very mentioning of the Kings Licenſe was a ſufficient acknowledgment of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative herein; however theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Proxee-Deputations,</hi> or derivative Writs (which I cite as Precedents) were regularly obtain'd.</p>

               <p n="1">1. HAving done with all the Degrees which are mention'd in the Act of Precedencies, and given an account by four <hi>Exemplars</hi> of the Writs to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Blood, of the Writs to the Archbiſhops and Biſhops, of the Writ to the Lord Chancellor, of the Writs to the Hereditary Nobles of Parliament, (<hi>viz.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:65438:174"/>Creation, or according to the Act of Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, but only by Writs, as Aſſiſtants, (for none do ſit there without Original Writs, except Proxies, and Maſters of Chancery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) as will be ſhewn. But before I treat of them diſtinctly, I ſhall ſet down ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on their Profeſſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe Aſſiſtants do all profeſs the Study and Knowledge of Laws, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have their Places allotted in the very heart of the Lords Houſe, that they may with the more eaſe give their Advice to that Noble Body, in all Matters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern either the Theory or Practice of what is juſt or fit to be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now there are certain Faculties and Vertues ſpringing from the Profeſſion of theſe Aſſiſtants (<hi>viz. Jus,</hi> or Right; <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia,</hi> or Juſtice; <hi>Judicium,</hi> or Judgment; <hi>Ratio,</hi> or Reaſon; <hi>Prudentia,</hi> or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; <hi>Aequitas,</hi> or Equity; <hi>Diſcretio,</hi> or Diſcretion; <hi>Sapientia,</hi> or Wiſdom; and <hi>Scientia Legum,</hi> or Knowledge of the Laws:) to whith (it is preſum'd) they have attain'd, and are thereby made fit for Aſſiſtants; yet that theſe Vertues may be the more diſtinctly diſcern'd, I ſhall take the freedom to explain them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jus,</hi> (the <hi>Latin</hi> for Right) is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on which <hi>Juſtitia,</hi> or Juſtice, is built.</p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:65438:174"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtitia</hi> is <hi>ſtatus,</hi> or <hi>ſtatio Juris, quia Jus ſtat vel exercetur per Juſtitiam.</hi> So that <hi>Jus</hi> is the principal, <hi>Juſtitia</hi> the Efflux of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Judicium,</hi> or Judgment, is the fix'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, determination, or ſentence of what is true, or falſe, good, or evil, juſt, or unjuſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> is a Ray of Divine Light, which guides a man to judge what is Juſt or Juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prudence</hi> is in the nature of Providence, (from <hi>Providere</hi>) to foreſee the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies or inconveniencies of ſo doing or not doing right to one man, that it may do good to one, and not hurt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſcretion</hi> is alſo to diſcern the nature or difference of things repreſented, and to manage them to their right end, and by this</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Equity</hi> is uſher'd in, which is a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious care that all things may be equally and proportionably done towards thoſe who exſpect Juſtice, when the matter concerns diſtinct perſons, or intereſts, and then</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sapientia</hi> or Wiſdom advanceth it ſelf, and includes the <hi>Scientia Legum,</hi> or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Laws, and that imploys all the Faculties of the Soul, and hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65438:175"/>Intellect and Inſpiration to ſee, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and manage all things to a juſt and right end, and teacheth the Profeſſors to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others in the principal Rules of perfect Converſation with each other, <hi>viz Honeſte vivere, neminem laedere, &amp; ſuum cui<expan>

               <p>All theſe do conſtitute a wiſe man, and the Profeſſors of Laws have more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to demonſtrate them to others, and by theſe Vertues they become Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd Aſſiſtants to a Parliament both in Divine and Human Matters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the Imbecility of our Human Nature is ſuch, that no man is ſo univerſally knowing in all things, as to give a true Judgment of all particulars, without a light or information from others, whereby to judge of what is juſt, right, or fit to be done; eſpecially in the contentions ariſing from the Mechanick Arts, or Trades, and ſome other Sciences, which are a ſignificant part of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of any Kingdom, or State; for ſuppoſing two Artificers, profeſſing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Arts, are both imployed to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of ſome Publick Work, wherein
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:65438:175"/>their joint Skills are neceſſarily required, in which they are at variance upon ſome my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical parts in their Trades, and without determination of their differences and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, neither of them can proceed in the joynt Deſign; and thereupon they refer themſelves to one of the Profeſſors of the Law, to ſettle the matter between them.</p>
               <p>But it is vulgarly thought beneath one of theſe eminent Profeſſors to dive into Mechanick Trades or leſſer Sciences; yet both of theſe Artiſts informing him of the true ſtate of the myſteries of their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Trades, the Judge from thence makes a rational determination of what is fit to be done, as well for the ſupport of their Trades, as for the common good to others, by preventing fallacies, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumventions, or the like conteſts; and this he gains from the impartments and arguments of theſe Artiſts, and ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their alternate allegations in one ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and the common good in another, he makes ſo peculiar a determination and Sentence, as to convince both parties, and this from the ground of their different Arts and Impartments.</p>
               <p>Now the Judge or Juſtice, even by theſe dayly accidents, and references, doth day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gain Knowledge, and by juſtly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:65438:176"/>this Knowledge grows to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eſteem'd a <hi>wiſe Man,</hi> not only from theſe lower particulars (upon which the Opinion of the Vulgar is founded but from his inſight and tranſacting in matters of a more tranſcendent nature, which dayly alſo come before him (either of Publick or Private Concerns.)</p>
               <p>But in all Tranſactions in this World there is a Right and a Wrong, which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is term'd Unjuſt, and ſometimes it may be poſitively judg'd to be ſo; yet it may ſo happen that <hi>ſummum jus</hi> may do injury, whereupon there is a neceſſity of interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Equity, leſt the Wrong by Cuſtom ſhould prove an eſteem'd Right, or that Right by neceſſary fix'd Rules, (which may be ſafe at one time and not at another) or an unlimited uſe or power, ſhould ſlide into Wrong; ſo as the due and critical time of applying this Equity to <hi>ſummum jus</hi> (which is gain'd by reading Law and Precedents) doth ſtill improve and exalt the Character of a <hi>wiſe Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But becauſe moſt men are either neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently or wilfully ignorant in the way of attaining theſe excellent Vertues, the wiſdom of all Governours hath (by the help of theſe learned Profeſſors) eſtabliſh'd certain Rules to direct men (which the <hi>Latin</hi> call <hi>Regulae,</hi> from <hi>Regere</hi>) intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:65438:176"/>the care of Governours in Exhibiting ſuch Rules for the good of thoſe who are under Tuition, but generally ſuch Rules are called Laws (which the <hi>Latins</hi> term <hi>Leges,</hi> from <hi>Legere,</hi> to Read) ſo as every man, who is not careleſs of his own Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity or Juſtice towards others, may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be inſtructed to what he ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In ancient times when People were not diſpers'd into various Regions, nor into great Societies of Towns, Cities and Kingdoms, but conſiſted of ſome few Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, or Villages, it was no hard matter to tranſmit thoſe Rules or Laws to one another, by ſinging them in Meeter, or ſome other ways of Tradition; but when thoſe leſſer Societies grew into the greater forms of Government, their Legiſlators invented a more certain way or art of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their juſt Rules or Laws, by legible Characters, Words, and Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, either Writ or Printed, (containing thoſe Rules) which (as I ſaid) were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, only certain tunable unwritten Inſtructions; and after, when mens diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions grew more and more deprav'd, there was ſomething of Coertion added to thoſe Laws, which Coertions (or inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Penalties for diſobedience to thoſe Laws) increas'd with the increaſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformable
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:65438:177"/>tempers: and herein there is nothing ſo great an argument of a wiſe and good diſpoſition, as when he makes it his ſtudy to ſatisfie himſelf (and thereby able to inform others) in the knowledge of ſuch Laws or Rules as may make our Lives in this World happy and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, which can no ways be obtain'd, but by knowing and obeying good Laws.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For theſe are they (as the learned Sir <hi>John Davies</hi> ſays) to which all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Common-wealths are indebted for all their temporal bleſſings of Peace, Plenty, Civility, and all moral parts of honeſty. By theſe (ſaith he) we injoy our Relations, Lands, Goods, good Names, or what ever is ſweet or dear unto us, for <hi>quid ſunt Regna niſi magna latrocinia ſine Juſtitia &amp; Legibus;</hi> the Land would be full of Thieves, the Sea of Pyrats, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons would riſe up againſt the Nobility, the Nobility againſt the Crown; without theſe there would be nothing certain, no Contracts, no Commerce, no Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but Confuſion, and even Diſſolution of Human Society: for good Laws are Comforts to the Griev'd, Counſels to the Perplex'd, Reliefs to the Circumvented, Preventions of Ruin to the Improvident, Preſervations to the Innocent, Supports to the Impotent; they Relieve the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd,

               <p n="7">7. For theſe reaſons, the Succeſſive Kings of this Iſland have conſtantly (as rewards) ſet ſuch a mark upon thoſe who are Profeſſors of the Laws, and whoſe ſtudy and experience in Laws have attain'd to ſo great a ſagacity, (as to know how to apply them to the publick good) that the chief of them is made Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, or Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <hi>England;</hi> (of whom I have ſpoken, who for the moſt part hath been a Profeſſor of Divinity, Law, or Equity) the next (of whom I am now to treat) is made Chief Juſtice of <hi>England;</hi> his very Title <hi>Juſtice</hi> rendring him in one ſence even Superior to the Law it ſelf; (for the Law it ſelf is but <hi>Lex tacens,</hi> but he that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributes that Law, is <hi>Lex loquens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. This Title of <hi>Juſtice</hi> (given alſo to every one of the twelve Judges or chief Diſpenſers of Laws) is ſo ancient, that in former times they were call'd <hi>Juſtitiae,</hi> (as containing that vertue not only in the ſingular, but in the plural number) and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:65438:178"/>afterwards they were call'd <hi>Juſtitiarii Angliae,</hi> and <hi>Juſtitiarii,</hi> (without addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Angliae</hi>) and after <hi>Juſtitiarii Regis,</hi> which laſt Title was to the four Juſtices of the <hi>Kings Bench;</hi> the chief of which four was anciently called <hi>Summus,</hi> and at this day <hi>Capitalis Juſtitiarius Angliae;</hi> (which generally we term in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi>) there was alſo anciently another ſort of <hi>Juſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arii ad placita,</hi> (applyed only to the four Juſtices of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> (the chief of which was, and is to this day alſo called <hi>Capitalis Juſtitiarius,</hi> (omitting <hi>Angliae</hi>) and which we in <hi>Engliſh</hi> term, the Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common Pleas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to eaſe the People from going for Juſtice to them, theſe Juſtices did go to the People, to diſtribute Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Theſe Motions in proceſs of time were call'd their Circuits, becauſe they did in a manner go round the Kingdom; and for theſe Motions they were called <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarii Itinerantes, &amp; Juſtitiarii ad Aſſiſas, Juratas &amp; Certificationes.</hi> There were alſo anciently another ſort of <hi>Juſtitiarii,</hi> (which it may be for diſtinction ſake were called <hi>Barones Scaccarii</hi>) conſiſting alſo of four; and this Title is applied only to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, where their Juſtice was to be
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65438:178"/>ſhewn in the management of the Revenue of the Crown; and theſe four alſo were and are conſtantly mixt with the other Eight, in their <hi>Itineranciis:</hi> in all making Twelve.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And for further Honor to theſe Eminent Profeſſors, as well out of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as in Parliament, they have pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Courts, (as <hi>Regalias</hi> allotted to them) wherein they have daily opportunities to manifeſt their Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Theſe Profeſſors I divide into three Orbs, and their Courts accordingly, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, the Court of <hi>Chancery;</hi> to the Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> the Court call'd the <hi>Kings Bench;</hi> to the Maſter of the Rolls (or Keeper of the moſt eminent Office of Records) the <hi>Rolls Chappel;</hi> (in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Court) to the other Lord Chief Juſtice, the Court of <hi>Common Pleas;</hi> to the Lord Chief Baron, the Court of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer;</hi> and theſe are the five Courts or <hi>Regalias</hi> belonging to five of the firſt Orb of that Profeſſion; yet not excluding the other Nine: ſo as,</p>
               <p>The ſecond Orb conſiſts of Nine more, <hi>viz.</hi> three Juſtices of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> three of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and three other Barons of the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> and theſe have gradual intereſts in thoſe three Courts, (as will
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:65438:179"/>be ſhewn) and with the other five do make fourteen, of the firſt and ſecond Orb; and as a further addition of Honor, twelve of theſe fourteen (in their Circuits twice every year) have Courts alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them, almoſt in every County of <hi>England</hi> (as will be ſhewn.)</p>
               <p>The third Orb of the Profeſſors of Law, are not uſually above ſix in number; (yet ſometimes more, ſometimes fewer (as will be ſhewn) I mean of ſuch only as have Summons to ſit in Parliament,) and theſe have Courts alſo allotted for them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Kings Serjeants at Law, the Kings Attorney General, the Kings Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor General, have the Inns of Courts, (though common alſo to under Graduates and Students) and the two principal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries of State have the Kings Court or Palace for their <hi>Regalias;</hi> ſo as the before mentioned five of the firſt Orb, and nine of the ſecond Orb, and ſix of the third Orb, (theſe three Orbs being the moſt eminent of that Profeſſion) have not only the Juriſdiction and an Intereſt in the ſaid Courts, but as an higher mark of Honour and Eſteem, though they were no Lords, or Barons of the Realm, yet they were and are uſually Summon'd by Writs to the High Court of Parliament, when ever it Aſſembled, and there they
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:65438:179"/>are alſo dignifi'd with peculiar Places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them, and many Priviledges of which, with their Number, and the Cauſes of Variation of that Number, I ſhall give an Account in the enſuing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

And thus fraught with knowledge of Laws, they bring them for the moſt part into the Hive, or compaſs of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Statute Law, and their univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal knowledge makes them eſteem'd Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their Learning indues them with Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, their Wiſdom enables them to be Juſtices or Judges out of Parliament, and in Parliament to be Aſſiſtants there, for the better carrying on of Publick Actions and Conſultations; ſo as the preſent Laws may be preſerved, or ſuch new ones made
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:65438:180"/>as their Wiſdoms ſhall think fit to adviſe; there being ſometimes as much neceſſity of making new, or correcting, altering, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, or inlarging the old, as in poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively preſerving them; for when a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs hath ſuſtain'd an Houſe many years, and is it ſelf decayed by time, it is to the ſafety of the Houſe, to have another Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter in its room; for <hi>tempora mutant mores,</hi> and <hi>mores</hi> may juſtly <hi>mutare leges,</hi> (conſidered according to the diverſity of circumſtances) and herein conſiſts the great Maſter-piece of advice, by turning a <hi>nolumus mutare,</hi> into a rational <hi>volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>

Cavendiſh Capital'Juſtic';</hi> and in <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifths time, to <hi>William Hanckford</hi> and many more) were inſerted; but when ever they were Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd meerly as Aſſiſtants, the words <hi>cum Praelatis,</hi> &amp;c. were left out, and ſo have been ever ſince <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourths time.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This Parliament Writ is directed, <hi>Capitali Juſtitiario noſtro ad placita,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo is his Writ by which he enjoys that great Office, yet his common and general appelation is, <hi>Capitali Juſtitiario Angliae,</hi> which we call Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſometimes, Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and by ſome one of thoſe Titles; he is called ſo in ſeveral Acts of Parliament, and ancient Records; (as I have hinted) and though the word Lord be added to his appellation, both in his Aſſiſtancies and Office, (and ſo to ſome
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65438:184"/>other of the Aſſiſtants) yet neither he nor they are to be counted Lords of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; for his Writ by which he enjoys his Office (which is the Inducement to his Aſſiſting Writ) is but <hi>durante Placito, (&amp; honore Officii)</hi> and his Aſſiſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but <hi>durante Parliamento,</hi> neither of them can ſix the Title further than the continuance of his Office or Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>And here it may be obſerved, that the word <hi>Vos</hi> (a word of great eminency, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſignifying a plural, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times apply'd to a ſingle Perſon) is us'd in this Official Writ (before mentioned) to the this Lord Chief Juſtice, but is not in his Parliament Writ, nor in any of the Patents or Parliament-Writs to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juſtices, of whom I ſhall ſpeak in order.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The antiquity of this great Miniſter of Juſtice, and his Court, is doubtleſs more ancient (under various Titles) than from <hi>Hen.</hi> the Thirds time; (from whence we vulgarly compute it,) for the Civilians do acknowledge that, <hi>Juſtitiarii ſunt umbrae quaedam illorum qui olim</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>apud Graecos dicebantur, deſignati ad Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodiam Juris &amp; aequitatis.</hi> However, Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> to prove its antiquity, tells us of an Epitaph in <hi>Ramſy</hi> Abby, ingraven on Stone in theſe words, <hi>Alvinus incliti
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65438:184"/>Regis Edgari Cognatus, totius Angliae Aldermannus,</hi> (ſaith, that by <hi>Aldermannus</hi> is meant, <hi>Capitalis Juſtitiarius Angliae,</hi> and conſequently his Aſſiſtance in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils before the name of Parliament, (and ſince that name) hath always been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd neceſſary, and (as he ſaith) all theſe Courts of <hi>Juſtice</hi> are ſo ancient, that they ſeem to have their Originals from Cuſtom, rather than by Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. His Juriſdiction is ſo great, as well out of Parliament as in Parliament, that often times the Lords do wave their own Power and Priviledges of uſing their own Officers, and do direct the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to ſend out his ſingle Warrant to Seize on Perſons in caſe of Treaſon, or Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of it, or for other high Crimes or Miſdemeanors; and the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> have likewiſe ſent to him to come to their <hi>Houſe</hi> upon the like occaſions, as happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when by their directions his Lordſhip ſent out Warrants to Seize the five Lords, of whom I ſhall ſpeak in the Chapter of Tryals.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Other uſes are alſo made of him, and ſome other of the Aſſiſtants in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for when the <hi>Lords</hi> have any matter of importance to impart to the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> then the Lord Chief Juſtice with the other Chief Juſtice, or Lord Chief
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:65438:185"/>Baron, or ſome other of the Judges (but always one of them, and no more) is joyn'd with him in delivering the ſame; but in matters of leſs importance, two Maſters of Chancery are imployed (as will be ſhewn.)</p>
                  <p n="12">12. When any Writs of Error, or Writs of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> or Tryals of Peers, or when any Pleas of the Crown, or other caſes Criminal, Civil, and ſometimes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick, or indeed any matters of Law are to be heard and determin'd in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as alſo in the penning of new, and altering, explaining or repealing of former Statutes, their aſſiſtances are required, and more eſpecially the Chief Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. The number of Aſſiſtants Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd by Writ to appear in Parliament, <hi>(Cum caeteris de Conſilio)</hi> from the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, to the 21. of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, conſiſted of an uncertain number, ſometimes above fourty, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under; but from the 21 of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, (from which time the extant <hi>Pawns</hi> do give an exact account of them) they never exceeded 27. and ſometimes were not above 13. or 14. But in all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments ſince <hi>Edw.</hi> the Firſts time, ſome of them were Summon'd, and very likely before; For Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> (though in his Breviary of Parliament Writs, <hi>pag.</hi> 36. he
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:65438:185"/>tells us of Twenty four Parliaments, (from the 49. of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Third, to the 49. of <hi>Edw.</hi> the Third) and many more which he ſaith he omits; of which Parliaments, he ſaith, there is no mention of Writs of Summons to any of the Kings Council, Juſtices, Officers, or others in the Rolls of theſe Parliaments; yet he kindly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes it to the negligence or ſlothfulneſs of Clerks, in omitting the entries of their Writs. This he ſaith, but he had done much better for his own juſtification and others ſatisfaction, (being intruſted by his Majeſty with the Records of the <hi>Tower</hi>) if thoſe Records which he cites, (both in his <hi>Breviary,</hi> and many others montion'd by him in Sir <hi>Robert Cottons Abridgment</hi>) now wanting, might have been reſtored by him to their ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories there.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. As to the Lord Chief Juſtice, and the Aſſiſtants Places in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> none of them, as I have ſaid, have their Places there by the Act of Precedency's, but rather by cuſtom and favour; of which I ſhall ſpeak more, when I come to the actual Sitting of the Parliament, as alſo of their Priviledges and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. As to the Officers which are under the Lord Chief Juſtice his Juriſdiction,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:65438:186"/>none of them are imployed about the Summoning of a Parliament, but many of them are imployed in other matters in time of Parliaments, as in caſes of Errors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but more chiefly upon Tryals of Peers, (when only the chief Clerk of the Crown in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> is the principal Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them) as will be ſhewn.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Regularly no Officer or Court, either in Parliament or out of Parliament, have greater Power or Juriſdiction, or more publick affairs to manage; (except the Lord Chancellor in Chancery) and yet in ſome caſes above it: For all appeals from the Chancery and other Courts, are determin'd in this Court, and no appeal from this Court, but to the High Court of Parliament, and all Records which are brought from other Courts into this, are never return'd back into thoſe Courts from whence they were brought, and many others which might be inſtanc't.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. To conclude, his Lordſhip, or the other Lord Chief Juſtice, or one of them, are conſtantly appointed to be Speaker of the <hi>Houſe of Lords, Pro tempore,</hi> when the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper is abſent, which is uſually done by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Writ, which I ſhall enter amongſt emergent Writs, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:65438:186"/>
                  <p>Thus having ſaid as much as I think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient concerning this Exemplar, with ſome intermixtures of ſome of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilars, I proceed to give a ſhort touch of each of the Conſimilars more diſtinctly; and firſt of the Maſter of the Rolls.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Conſimilar Writ to the Maſter of the Rolls.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THE Office of Maſter of the Rolls is granted by Patent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeveral Titles, <hi>viz. Clericus parvae Bugae &amp; Cuſtos Rotulorum &amp; Magiſter Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Converſorum,</hi> and he Sits in the Rolls to hear Cauſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by vertue of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But his Writ of Summons to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is directed as in this Pawn, <hi>viz. Harbotello Grimſton Baronetto Magiſtro Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulorum Cancellariae ſuae,</hi> and then the remaining part of his Conſimilar, as alſo the reſt of the following Conſimilar Writs, agree in the ſame words with the Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar to the Lord Chief Juſtice, as in Sect. the Eleventh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This <hi>Magiſter Rotulorum,</hi> or <hi>Cuſtos Rotulorum,</hi> or <hi>Clericus parvae bugae,</hi> is the ſame which we call in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſter of the Rolls, anciently call'd Clerk of the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65438:187"/>Rolls; but from <hi>Henry</hi> the Sevenths time, when the Clergy did decline in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Imployments, he was and is ſtill call'd Maſter of the Rolls.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the abſence of the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor or Lord Keeper, he Sits as Judge in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and therefore by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> is call'd his Aſſiſtant, and at other times he Sits as Judge of Cauſes in the Chappel of that Houſe, which in <hi>Henry</hi> the Thirds time, was imployed as a place of Charity to ſuch <hi>Jews</hi> as ſhould turn to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> but thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baniſh't, <hi>Edward</hi> the Third did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it for the keeping of Records, and joined it to the Office of <hi>Cuſtos Rotulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and of the <hi>Pettibag,</hi> (which Office of <hi>Pettibag</hi> ſeems to be a leſſer Bag or place of Records.)</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So that he hath three Titles, <hi>viz. Clericus Pettibagae,</hi> or Clerk of the <hi>Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibag;</hi> (he being the chief of three Clerks more of that Office) Secondly, <hi>Magiſter Rotulorum,</hi> or Maſter of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> (or Clerk or Preſerver of ſuch Records as do at any time paſs the Great Seal, and are ſent to his Cuſtody, either in the Office of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> called the <hi>Rolls Office,</hi> or to the <hi>Pettibag Office</hi>) where his under Clerks do attend on purpoſe to produce them as occaſions require.</p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:65438:187"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, His third Title is Maſter of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> which Title is given to twelve Perſons, of which twelve he is te chief.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Formerly, and even to this day, the greateſt part of theſe Twelve were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of Doctors of the Civil Law; however Eleven of thoſe are ſo conſtantly diſpos'd of, as that ſome of them do Sit in the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> in time of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at other times with the Lord Chancellor in the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hearing of Caſes, others with the Maſter of the Rolls, when he Sits in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> or at the <hi>Rolls,</hi> where he hath a Juriſdiction to hear or determin Cauſes, yet appealable to the Lord Chancellor.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There are other Maſters of <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> call'd Extraordinary, and ſix Clerks of eminent Quality, and other Clerks im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed both in the <hi>Chancery</hi> and <hi>Rolls;</hi> but theſe are not Summon'd to Parliaments, (of whom I ſhall ſpeak more) but in in thoſe capacities which I have mention'd, the Maſter of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> as Maſter of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> or chief Clerk of the <hi>Pettibag,</hi> or both, or chief Maſter of <hi>Chancery,</hi> or in all three Capacities, he is very Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Parliament, eſpecially in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Summons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:65438:188"/>
                  <p>For as I have ſhewn in <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. whenever the Kings Warrant is ſent to the Lord Chancellor to iſſue out Writs for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Lordſhip either ſends it, or a like Warrant, to the Maſter of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> who as chief Clerk of the <hi>Pettibag</hi> cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the other Clerks of the Office to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs all the Writs, (both for the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> and <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi>) ſo as they may be fit for the Great Seal; and theſe being thus done, and fairly abſtracted and ingroſs't into a Roll, (which is call'd the Parliament <hi>Pawn,</hi> and lies there as a Memorial and Record of what they have done, and as a Preſident for the future) all the particular Writs mention'd or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in that <hi>Pawn</hi> (being fitted) are carried to the Lord Chancellor; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his preſence Seal'd, they are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately delivered to Meſſengers belonging to the Chancellor, who do take care to diſpoſe ſome to the Perſons to be Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd for the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> and others to the reſpective Sheriffs of all Counties, and Comitated Cities, for Elections of ſuch as are to ſit in the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> and ſo the Maſter of the <hi>Rolls</hi> and the Clerks of the <hi>Pettibag</hi> having done all their parts, and the Meſſengers and Sheriffs theirs, the ſame Writs which concern the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> are or ought to be return'd to the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:65438:188"/>Clerk of the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> at the firſt Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the Writs for Elections are to be return'd by the reſpective Sheriffs to the Clerk of the <hi>Chancery Crown Office,</hi> and not to the <hi>Pettibag,</hi> (as hath and will be ſhewn) for they come no more there till ſome time after Diſſolution of a Parliament; and then for eaſe of that Office, and more ſafely preſerving them, they are order'd to be carried to the Rolls, and from thence to the <hi>Tower,</hi> all which will be more fully ſhewn; which method I often repeat in this Treatiſe, becauſe I find it ſo much neglected.</p>
                  <p>As to the Imployment of the other Eleven Maſters of the <hi>Chancery</hi> in time of Parliament, I ſhall ſhew it in a diſtinct Chapter.</p>
                  <p>This Maſter of the <hi>Rolls</hi> doubtleſs hath been anciently Summon'd to Sit in the <hi>Lords Houſe;</hi> yet I find no Writs iſſued to him till the <hi>36th.</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and then as Maſter of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> not as chief Maſter of <hi>Chancery;</hi> and after that he was Summon'd to all Parliaments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>39th.</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and firſt of King <hi>James;</hi> and in this very Parliament a Writ was prepared for him, but being Elected a Member of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> his attendance was not requir'd in the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> for what reaſon I know not;
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:65438:189"/>but he hath his place whenever he Sits there, next to the Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> upon the ſecond Woolſack, as will be ſhewn in the Chapter of Places.</p>

                     <p>HIS Writ of Summons to Sit in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, is alſo <hi>Capitali Juſtitiario noſtro de Banco,</hi> (<hi>mutato nomine,</hi> in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words agreeing with the Exemplar) and here it may be again obſerved, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent vulgar miſunderſtandings, That the Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> is Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> or upper <hi>Bench,</hi> and this is Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:65438:189"/>Bench;</hi> and ſometimes one is call'd Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Pleas</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> as in the <hi>Latin</hi> words, <hi>De placitis Coronae,</hi> and this Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> or <hi>Communia Placita,</hi> yet in the <hi>Latin</hi> Writ it is <hi>de Banco;</hi> ſo as both Courts are call'd Bancks or Benches, and both call'd alſo Courts of Pleas, in reſpect of Pleas or Pleadings; one properly concerns the King in matters Criminal; the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Pleas or Pleadings of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty or Common People among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in matters Civil, and one alſo is call'd the Upper Bench, the other the Common Bench, and therefore (what ever the Patent or Writs are, yet for an eaſier diſtinction) I here intitle one, the Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> the other Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common-Pleas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for the names <hi>Bench</hi> or <hi>Banc, Pleas</hi> or <hi>Placita,</hi> I refer them to my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Chief Juſtice hath three more Juſtices to aſſiſt him in this Court.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That which makes the eminency of this Court is, That only the learned Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants of the <hi>Coife</hi> (of whom I ſhall ſpeak in order, being the next Degree to Judges) do Plead in this Court, (yet not prohibited from Pleading in all other Courts) but all other Graduans of Law
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65438:190"/>have the liberty to Plead in all other Courts, but not in this.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Pleas of this Court cannot be ſo well aſcertain'd, as that of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> becauſe the Pleas held by Common Perſons, or between Subject and Subject, are devided into as many Branches as Actions, and the Actions into as many Cauſes as there are variety of Conteſts in the Kingdom; yet all theſe Actions, Cauſes and Conteſts, are included under three notions, Real, Perſonal, and Mixt, which are here tried as they happen according to the ſtrict Rules of Law. As for Perſonal and Mixt Actions they are tried in other Courts, but Real Actions are only Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable here, nor are any Fines of Concord (which is obſervable) levied in any Court but this, ſo that (as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſaith) the Motto of this Court may be, <hi>Haec eſt finalis Concordia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Upon theſe and other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the neceſſity of requiring Aſſiſtances from the Juſtices of this Court may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: For as the Juſtices of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> may acquaint the Lords with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the King; ſo the Juſtices of the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> may moſt properly acquaint them with what concerns the People, whereby Laws for either may be corrected, repeal'd, or made <hi>de novo,</hi> as ſhall be thought moſt expedient.</p>

                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p>THIS Chief Baron hath four more Barons to aſſiſt him in his proper Court of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> whereof the puiſne, or youngeſt made Baron of the four, is not an <hi>Itinerant Juſtice,</hi> nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in the number of the Twelve Judges.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe Barons are not ſuch as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd of the next Degree to Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> nor ſuch as are meerly Barons by Courteſy, or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of Court Barons, or Barons of the <hi>Cinqueports,</hi> (of whom I ſhall ſpeak more, when I treat of them in the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi>) but are great Officers of Juſtice; and ſo his Writ calls him <hi>Baro Scaccarij,</hi> or Baron of an Officiate Place; but the Writ to the noble Baron before mention'd, is to an Hereditary Place, <hi>viz. Johan Nevil, Baro de Abergaveny,</hi> and ſo to others of that Degree.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Some think they were call'd Barons, becauſe the Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently manag'd by noble Barons; but as <hi>Okham</hi> ſaith, that theſe Barons were to be <hi>Majores &amp; Diſcretiores,</hi> &amp;c. being either cull'd out of the Clergy or Laity, or the Kings Court; and for many ages, the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:65438:191"/>chief of theſe five Barons was call'd as now, (both in his Patent and Writ) <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalis Baro,</hi> and generally is Intitled the Lord Chief Baron: the other four Barons do aſſiſt him in all matters between the King and his Subjects, in caſes properly appertaining to Aſſize, Exchequer, or the Kings Revenue.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He is the chief Judge of that Court in matters of Law, as alſo of Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any abuſes therein, and of Pleas upon them, and ſolely gives order for Judgment, (wherein the Lord Treaſurer thinks not fit to concern himſelf.)</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He alone without other Barons in Term time, Sits in Afternoons at <hi>Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> upon <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> (upon caſes which ariſe in <hi>London,</hi> and cannot be diſpatch't in the Mornings) he takes Recognizances of Debt, Appearances, and Obſervances of Orders, he takes the Preſentations of all Offices unto himſelf, and cauſeth an Oath to be given to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London.</hi> He takes Audits, Accounts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in his abſence, and ſometimes to eaſe him, the ſecond and third Baron hath the like power, and the fourth takes the Oath of Sheriffs; and as I ſaid, the three firſt of the five have conſtantly their Writs of Summons to a Parliament, yet the fifth is alſo of good uſe in that Office, but
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:65438:192"/>hath no Writ of Summons as the other.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That which is moſt obſervable of this Court is, that all Caſes of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> or <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> are ſtill Adjourn'd to the <hi>Exchequer Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and there with the Barons Debated, Argued, and Reſolved by all the Twelve Judges, (whereof the four firſt Barons make four of the Twelve.)</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This Court conſiſts of two parts, the upper <hi>Exchequer</hi> and the lower; the upper is that wherein theſe Barons do exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Juſtice: but herein the Lord Treaſurer, as Superviſor, may Sit as oft as he pleaſeth, however once in every Term he ſeldom fails to Sit, and hear Matters; but the lower <hi>Exchequer</hi> is chiefly under the care of the Lord Treaſurer, (the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of upper and lower being diſtinct) yet both of them (conſidered jointly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of the <hi>Exchequer</hi>) do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude eight Courts or Offices, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Court of Pleas;</hi> (in ſome manner like the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> and <hi>Common-Pleas</hi>) Secondly, The <hi>Court of Accounts;</hi> Thirdly, The <hi>Court of Receipts;</hi> Fourthly, The <hi>Court of the Exchequer Chamber;</hi> (being for the Aſſembly of all the Judges of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (as I ſaid) for Matters in Law for ſpecial Verdict; Fifthly, The <hi>Court of Exchequer Chamber,</hi> for Errors in the

Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Clerks.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. From which may be computed what variety of buſineſs this Court doth afford to a Parliament, though not in the troubles of Summoning it, yet by bringing in and iſſuing out of Money, (which are the Nerves of a Kingdom, and Arteries of a Parliament) ſo as the Progreſſes of this (and the incluſive Courts) do occaſion more Debates in Parliament, than what ever do ariſe from the <hi>Chancery, Rolls, Kings Bench,</hi> or <hi>Common-Pleas.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe Serjeants at Law in the <hi>Latin</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelation are call'd, <hi>Servientes ad Legem,</hi> for Serjeant and Servant are the ſame,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:65438:196"/>only differing by a vulgar Pronunciation, or the Idiom of our Language, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten renders an A. for an E; for properly Servant ought to be writ Servient, from <hi>Servio</hi> to Serve, or from <hi>Servare</hi> to Keep, ſo as they may be ſaid to be as well Keepers of the Laws, as Servients to the Law.</p>
                  <p>As theſe are <hi>Servientes ad Legem,</hi> ſo there are another ſort, (of which I ſhall ſpeak) who are Attendants in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> call'd <hi>Servientes ad Arma,</hi> but <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Arma togae;</hi> therefore I proceed to Serjeants at Law.</p>
                  <p>The Gradations to this Title are thus attain'd, <hi>viz.</hi> After the young Students of the Law have continued Seven Years in the Inns of Courts, and have done their Moots, or <hi>Motus ad Literarum,</hi> and other exerciſes, they are called or admitted to plead at the Bar of any Court, (except the <hi>Common-Pleas</hi>) and are thereupon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Barreſters, and thereby alſo gain the Title of Eſquire.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carolus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>dilecto &amp; fideli ſuo</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanni Glin <hi>Militi</hi> Servienti domino Regi ad legem <hi>Quia, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo <hi>verbatim</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Exemplar before recited to the Lord Chief Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The other was <hi>Johanni Maynard militi,</hi> who had the like Writ prepared for him.</p>
                  <div type="observations">
                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THESE Profeſſors of Law are call'd <hi>Servientes ad Legem</hi> in all Writs, (which are generally Writ in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>) but in <hi>Engliſh</hi> (as I ſaid) they are
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65438:198"/>called Serjeants or Servants at Law, alſo Serjeant of the Coif, (from the white Coif which they wear uppermoſt at the Solemnization of their Order) but at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times under a black Cap, like the Twelve Judges, becauſe having paſt this Order, they are then capable of being made one of the Twelve Judges, and to exerciſe the imployment of a Judge upon emergent occaſions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. None of all the three Orbs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors have a Writ for their Office and Imployment, but the Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> (as I have ſhewn) and theſe Serjeants at Law. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Writs are, that in the Writ to the Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> (as to his Office) and ſo in the Patents to the other Juſtices, (as to their Offices) there is nothing but a <hi>Conſtituimus,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any adjunct of Compliment, but in this Writ to the Serjeants at Law, it is <hi>Fideli noſtro;</hi> yet in both of their Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to a Parliament, they have equal words, <hi>viz. Dilecto &amp; Fideli.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the Writ of the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> there is no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Council mention'd; but in the Writ to every Serjeant at Law, the words are as in Parliament Writs, <hi>Quia de ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſamento concilij noſtri,</hi> and ſo in the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65438:198"/>Mandatory part of it, <hi>Vobis Mandamus firmiter injungend',</hi> and then under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of a 1000 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> to take upon them that Degree; and in their ſecond Writ to be the Kings Serjeant at Law, they have <hi>Vadage, Feodage, Veſturage, &amp; Regardage,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak in my <hi>Annotations;</hi> yet I ſhall give this hint here, That the word <hi>Inveſtitura</hi> is us'd only in the Patents of Creation of the Lords Temporal, and <hi>Veſtura</hi> only us'd in the Patents to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants at Law, and to no other Degree that ſit in the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> as Peers, or Aſſiſtants.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That which makes this Degree more eminent is, that by virtue of the firſt Writ, (to be a Serjeant at Law in general) they continue their Title of Serjeant at Law, <hi>Durante vita;</hi> (though not expreſt in the Writ) the other to be the Kings Serjeant at Law is equal with that Writ to the Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and to the other Eleven Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, <hi>viz. Durante beneplacito;</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> Writ gives him an intereſt in Parliament.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is to be noted, That all the twelve Judges before they can take upon them thoſe Offices of Judges, are made Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants at Law; ſo that though they quit thoſe Offices of Judges, and thereby looſe the dignity of their Office, yet the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:65438:199"/>dignity of their Serjeantſhip ſtill remains during life.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It may be here pertinently obſerved, That though Writs were prepar'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll'd in the <hi>Pettibag</hi> for theſe two Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, yet whether the Writs were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them, I cannot inform my ſelf, or whether the delivery was declined in reſpect both of them were choſen Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> (where Sir <hi>John Glyn</hi> did ſit during his liſe, and Sir <hi>John Maynard</hi> during the continuance of this Parliament) or whether they were conniv'd at, as being more ueful in the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> (or to themſelves) for being once admitted to ſit in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> they might not Plead in other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Courts, which had been much to their prejudice.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Kings Attorney is placed in this <hi>Pawn</hi> before the two Serjeants, which was ſome miſtake in the Clerks; and ſo I find the like miſplacings of others in many other <hi>Pawns;</hi> and therefore in this my method, I purſue the order of all ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Solemnities as they uſually attend, and of their precedent ſitting in the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> (as will be ſhewn) and ſo place them here, as they are placed there.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. As to the Antiquity and number of Serjeants which were formerly Summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:65438:199"/>to Parliaments, it is manifeſt that more or leſs of them were Summond in moſt Parliaments of former Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edw. 3d. Rich. 2d. Hen. 5th.</hi> and <hi>Hen. 6th.</hi> (as appears in the Clauſe Rolls of thoſe Parliaments) and more eaſily ſeen in Mr. <hi>Prinns Breviary,</hi> or in the Rolls Chappel; (for it were too great a diverſion to recite them here) but thoſe of latter days do appear thus in the <hi>Pettibag, viz.</hi> in the 21. <hi>Hen. 8th.</hi> there were three Summon'd; but in the <hi>30th.</hi> none; in the <hi>36th.</hi> of <hi>Hen. 8th.</hi> four; in the firſt of <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> three; in the 6. of <hi>Edw. 6th.</hi> four; in the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>Edw. 6th.</hi> four; in the firſt of <hi>Mary,</hi> two; and alſo in the firſt of <hi>Mary,</hi> two; and in the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> one; in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> one; and in the <hi>4th.</hi> and <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> two; in the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> two; in the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> one; in the <hi>35th.</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> three; in the <hi>39th.</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> one; in the firſt of <hi>Jacob.</hi> three; in the 21. of <hi>Jac.</hi> five; in the firſt <hi>Car. prim.</hi> four; in the 15. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. three; in the <hi>13th. Car. 2d.</hi> the two before mentioned; for whom Writs were order'd, but not actually Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, (as I have ſhewn.)</p>
                     <p n="9">9. In the <hi>39th. Eliz.</hi> the Writs to the three Serjeants are directed diſtinctly,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:65438:200"/>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni, &amp; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni,</hi> but in all the reſt, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vienti ad Legem,</hi> without the addition of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni,</hi> nor do I find <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni</hi> added in any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Writs, before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, but only this, <hi>viz.</hi> 4 <hi>Hen. 5th. Johanni Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guayes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>no Servienti Regis ad Legem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. And as a peculiar diſtinction, the Kings eldeſt Serjeants have the Priviledge to Plead in all Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bar, but only in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> (where no other Graduats of Law but themſelves can Plead, as I have ſhewn) and there all the Serjeants ſtand without the Bar.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. They are alſo ſometimes Aſſiſtants to the Judges, and to the Lord Chancellor and Maſter of the Rolls, and many times in caſe of age or infirmneſs of the Judges, they do ſupply their places, both in the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and in their Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and Circuits, <hi>Pro hac vice,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on death of any of them, if the King think fitting, they are Conſtituted Judges in their Vacancies, and this by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. As to their places in Parliament, they are next the Judges, as ſhall be ſhewn in the local part of this Treatiſe, as alſo of their Imploymens, <hi>ſedente Parliamento.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus having brought the <hi>Servientes ad Legem,</hi> to be <hi>Judices &amp; Magiſtros legum,</hi>

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65438:204"/>and Martial Imployments; and that it may ſo appear, in the aforeſaid Act of the 31. of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eighth, none of the other Aſſiſtants before recited (except the Lord Chancellor) are ſo much as mention'd therein, (their precedencies being known in their own Courts from a greater anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity) but the Secretaries Place is fix't by that Act, <hi>viz.</hi> if he be under the Degree of a Noble Baron, yet it is above all the Aſſiſtants and next the Lord Chancellor; if he be of the Degree of a Baron, then above all Barons, or if an Earl, (as in the caſe of the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi>) then above all of that Degree, unleſs any of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Officers of State be of that Degree, and then next to him and above the reſt.</p>

                     <head>Obſervations.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THis Writ agrees with all the former, except in the word <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni,</hi> and ſo if there be more; (as I have ſhewn in the Writ to the Judges) yet commonly in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcriptions, he that is made Chief is Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Principal without the word <hi>one;</hi> and the other One of the Principal Secretaries of State.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The word <hi>Capitalis</hi> is us'd in the Writs to the two Chief Juſtices and Chief Baron; but to the chief Secretary the word <hi>Principali</hi> is us'd, not only ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Capital, Firſt, or Chief, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating his more immediate Imployment on his Prince, for <hi>Principali</hi> is properly from <hi>Principe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. If there be more Secretaries than one, (as there are ſeldom leſs than two) they divide their negotiations into the Title of Provinces, both in relation to this Kingdom, or Foreign Kingdoms or States; and ſo each of them give an account to the King accordingly, and they have an Office appertaining to them, call'd the Signet Office,<note place="margin">Signet.</note> where they have four Clerks as their Subſtitutes to perform their Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for all Diſpatches both Foreign and Domeſtick, and generally they are of his Majeſties Privy-Council.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Their Imployments in Parliament are either in the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> or <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> according as they are Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd to one, or Elected to the other, and as the King thinks them in either place moſt uſeful for his occaſions.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I need not go back to find the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of their Summons, for it may be preſum'd to be ancient from the Eminency and nature of their Imployments; ſo it may ſuffice only to inſtance here, that in the 36 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>William Packet Mil.</hi> had his Writ, <hi>Secretario ſuo,</hi>

                     <p n="6">6. The dignity of this Office is ſhewn in their Summons and Place in the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> according to the Act of <hi>Precedency;</hi> but I muſt ſay ſomething more of the antiquity of the Office, and of the nature of ſuch are imployed in it.</p>
                     <p>If he be taken for a Scribe, becauſe they write the Kings literal Diſpatches; it had the ſame eſteem among the <hi>Hebrews</hi> that the <hi>Magi</hi> had with the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and the <hi>Quindecemviri</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> (which latter were the Expounders of the Secrets of <hi>Sybills</hi> Oracles) Theſe Scribes were uſually ſelected out of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and not out of the Laity, ſo that ſuch as were uſed out of the Laicks were call'd <hi>Notarij,</hi> and not Scribes; and ſuch as were us'd by the Clergy were call'd Clerks from <hi>Cleros,</hi> becauſe the Clergy by reaſon of their learning did for the moſt part Guide both Secular and Spiritual Affairs; but the word Secretary (in which Office the Clergy in former times were more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:65438:207"/>imployed than Laymen) doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſomething of another nature, being derived from <hi>Secretum,</hi> and that from <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> the Supine of <hi>Cerno,</hi> to ſee or diſcern; ſo by adding <hi>Se</hi> to <hi>Cretum,</hi> it makes <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and renders the Perſon imployed in that Office to be one who knows <hi>Se (id eſt)</hi> himſelf, and can alſo Judiciouſly diſcern and judge of other mens matters, and yet reſerve the Determination or Execution of them in his own breaſt; and for this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacity of mind, he is properly call'd a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, and the Kings Secretary, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State, as a preſerver of the Secrets of the King and Kingdom for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private uſe, till juſt occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their impartments to others; and indeed conſidering the perpetual Deſigns of Princes towards each other, and the Diſcontents and Seditious Humors which are in every Kingdom; there is no quality more requiſite to a Miniſter of State, than a ſecret and reſerved mind, and more particularly to this Officer, his very Title intimating his Duty, in which he ought to be maſter of three Properties;<note place="margin">Lord Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam.</note> a Prudent Diſpatch, Exquiſite Intelligence, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy in all; for by theſe (eſpecially the laſt) all Minings and underminings are ſtill diſappointed by the rules of Politick Secrecy; by which Art, Kingdoms are
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65438:207"/>kept in quiet, by quenching fires before they flame; and becauſe this requires not only a great skill but as great a vigilancy, which few are capable to perform; <hi>Boca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini</hi> tells us in his pleaſant <hi>Chapter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the World,</hi> that to eaſe it of this indifatigable trouble, without uſing ſo many Meanders; <hi>Apollo</hi> reſolved to make a Window in every mans breaſt, ſo as at firſt view, each man might ſee the thoughts and intentions of each other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prevent the prejudices which daily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe for want thereof; but before <hi>Apollo</hi> did execute his Reſolves, he caus'd the Wiſe Men of <hi>Greece</hi> with ſome others of the <hi>Literati</hi> to be Summon'd, and to give their Opinions therein, where <hi>Thales</hi> was the firſt that preſs't for it with ſuch Arguments, that <hi>Apollo</hi> was almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd; but at laſt he was diſſwaded by many other Lawyers, Poets, Phyſicians and Theologicks by more convincing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, ſhewing that nothing caus'd a greater reverence to thoſe and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, than the myſteries which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in them, which would make them contemptible, if they ſhould be ſeen or known by every vulgar Eye, whereupon the Windows were not made.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Now the ſame reaſons which were us'd againſt making theſe Windows in the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:65438:208"/>Bodies of Men, may ſerve to oppoſe the Windows too often made in the Bodies of ſuch Councils or Parliaments as are to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a Kingdom, where every Member or Counſellor indeed ſhould be a Secretary of State; becauſe the publiſhing of Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations commonly meets with Seditious Tempers, who think nothing is well done but what is done by themſelves, looking meerly on the Fact and Succeſs, not on the Deliberations, Grounds and debated Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that Fact; for it is not the event which makes the reaſon of managing that Fact to be the leſs Reaſon; for let the event be good or bad, the reaſon is ſtill the ſame; if the Reaſon be good and ſolid, yet the Event bad, it may be ſaid, that it meets with an ill conſtellation; but if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be bad and the Event as ill, the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of theſe do ſtill raiſe a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation; and if the Reaſon be bad and the Event good, (if the bad Reaſon be kept ſecret) the glory of the Event would quickly drown the cenſure of the bad Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and make the Counſellors ſtand fair; but if divulged, they are ſure not only to loſe the credit of the Event, but double the diſrepute, if both be bad.</p>
                     <p>Herein ſome men are naturally of a more reſerved temper than others; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thoſe are only fit to be Counſellors
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65438:208"/>and Secretaries of State, who have no Windows in their Breaſt; that is, no ſuch tranſparent Eyes, as men may eaſily ſee their diſpoſures of Affairs, but can wiſely keep the Secrets of State from other mens Inſpections: and in Parliaments I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch Tempers are very uſeful, for if the People Truſt them, they do well in performing their Truſt; but appealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the People, ſhews a diffidence in their own Judgments.</p>
                     <p>Thus having ſhewn the Kings Warrant in the Front, and the Secretaries Writ in the Rear, and fix't the Noble Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe who manage the Laws Divine, and thoſe who are Aſſiſtants in Human Laws, and run through the moſt conſtant Writs which are us'd for Summoning ſuch as are to fit in a Parliament, either as Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, or Aſſiſting Members thereof; I ſhould now proceed to the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> but I ſhall crave leave; Firſt, To ſpeak of ſome accidentall Writs for Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; Secondly, Of the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of all the aforeſaid Writs; Thirdly, Of ſuch as ſit there without Writ or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; Fourthly, Of ſuch as ſit there only by Patent; and Fifthly, Of ſome other Officers who are imployed there by vertue of Patents.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of Conſimilar Writs and Patents upon Emergent occaſions.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I Find in Mr. <hi>Prins Breviary,</hi> That he cites many Records long before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; (which I ſhall not examine, becauſe ſome of them have been ſo long diſus'd) Of Knights, Juſtices of <hi>North Wales,</hi> Treaſurer of <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> Treaſurer of the Kings Houſe, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Deans, Archdeacons, Eſcheators, (and one <hi>Magiſter Thomas Yong,</hi> which he takes to be a Maſter of <hi>Chancery</hi>) that have been Summon'd by Writ to ſit in Parliaments in the <hi>Lords Houſe;</hi>) but ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth in the Pettibag, ſeveral Writs of Aſſiſtants were iſſued, as I have ſhewn in the <hi>11th.</hi> Chap. Sect. 9. to ſhew the Kings Power, ſome of which were Profeſſors of the Law, and ſome not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was another Writ, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Warden of the <hi>Cinqueports;</hi> (which was not conſtant, but occaſional) for ſometimes it was directed to an Earl, and ſometimes to ſome one Perſon under the Degree of a Baron; yet by vertue of the Writ, he was
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65438:209"/>impowr'd to ſit in the <hi>Lords Houſe;</hi> but ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourths time, when that Office was ſupplied by the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> (after called <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth) who had a Writ with the addition of <hi>Guardian' Quinque Portuum</hi>) that Truſt hath been committed to ſome one of the Blood Royal, and from that Writ other Writs are derived to all the <hi>Cinqueports.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in reſpect this Writ (as to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) is moſtly concern'd about E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of 16. Members to ſerve in the <hi>Houſe of Commons;</hi> I ſhall refer the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of it to the ſecond part, in that Chapter which particularly treats of the <hi>Cinqueports.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If at any time the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper be abſent upon juſt occaſion, as when the Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgman</hi> in this Parliament was Sick; a Patent was made for Sir <hi>John Vaughan,</hi> then Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> to ſupply his place, and the like to Sir <hi>Francis North,</hi> Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> alſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and though for the moſt part this happens in time of Parliament; yet, becauſe it may happen between the time of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and the Sitting of a Parliament, (which is the chief deſign of this part of this Treatiſe) I have thought fit to enter
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65438:210"/>the form of that Patent in this place, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than defer it, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of Returns of Writs relating to the Summoning of ſuch as are to Sit in the <hi>Lords Houſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN all Judicial Courts from whence Writs do iſſue, there is care taken for their due Returns, as may be ſeen in <hi>Fitz Herbert,</hi> and ſuch Authors who have treated of the nature of Writs and their Returns; but none of them giving a full account of Parliament Writs and Returns, gives me occaſion to inſert this Chapter.</p>
               <p>As to the Return of the Writs to the Lords Spiritual, and Temporal and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, they ought (by every individual Perſon who had a Writ) to be deliver'd to the Clerk of the Parliament before the Houſe Sit, or immediately upon their Entrance into the Houſe, at the Table, and by the ſaid Clerk they are to be kept with the Records of that Houſe.</p>
               <p>By the omiſſion of this method many inconveniencies have and may happen to their Succeſſors or Poſterity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is wiſht there were more care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their due Returns; to which they may be incourag'd, being of ſo little
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:65438:211"/>trouble in the performance. But as to the return of Writs concerning the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> the method conſiſts of much trouble and perplexity, not only from the time of the executing the Writs, but in undue returns, as will be ſhewn in their proper place.</p>
               <p>This Chapter concluding all the Patents and Writs of Summons, and Returns which concern the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> (by vertue of which the Perſons ſo Summon'd by Writ do ſit there) now I muſt ſpeak of ſuch as ſit there without Patent or Writ of Summons; and firſt of the Maſters of <hi>Chancery.</hi>

               </head>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THE Secretaries of State did bring up the Rear of the State Officers, and now the Maſters of <hi>Chancery</hi> do bring up the Rear of the Aſſiſtants; and though I have ſpoke ſomething of the Maſter of the Rolls, partly as chief of the twelve Maſters of <hi>Chancery;</hi> yet, there he was conſidered as Maſter of the Rolls, (or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords) rather than one of the twelve Maſters of <hi>Chancery,</hi> whereof (as I ſaid)
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:65438:212"/>he is the chief; and theſe twelve are called Maſters in Ordinary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For there are alſo other Maſters in <hi>Chancery,</hi> called Extraordinary, which are of an uncertain number, according to the buſineſſes of the reſpective Counties wherein they are imployed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for the twelve, they uſually are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of Barreſters of the Common Law, or Doctors of the Civil Law, and eleven of them do ſit in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> or in the Rolls as Aſſiſtants, ſaith Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>) to the Lord Chancellor and to the Maſter of the Rolls, every day throughout each Term of the year, and to them are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Interlocutory Reports, and ſtating of Accounts, and ſometimes (by way of reference to them) they are impowr'd with a final Determination of Cauſes there depending.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe twelve have time out of mind, ſat in the <hi>Lords Houſe;</hi> yet have neither Writs nor Patents (for many Ages paſt) impowering them ſo to do; but I conceive, as the Maſter of the Rolls is (as is ſaid by that Inſtitutor) an Aſſiſtant to the Lord Chancellor, the remaining eleven may fairly be ſaid to be Aſſiſtants both to the Lord Chancellor and Maſter of the Rolls, in all or moſt Matters, depending in both
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:65438:212"/>or either Courts, and ſo <hi>Virtute Officij,</hi> they are incluſively capacitated, (by the Writs to the Lord Chancellor, or Maſter of the Rolls) to be Aſſiſtants to them in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> as they are in <hi>Chancery,</hi> without any particular VVrit or Patent to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Anciently this Title was higher than what Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> affords them; for I find in an old Manuſcript in the hands of Sir <hi>J. C.</hi> one of the Maſters, (but I have not the opportunity of ſearching the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords therein mentioned) Intitutled, <hi>De Cancellario Angliae &amp; ejus Cojudicibus, &amp; de authoritate eorum,</hi> and then follows, <hi>viz. In dicta Curia Cancellarij ſunt ordinati duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decem Cojudices, viz. Magiſtri ſive Clerici de prima forma ad Robas,</hi> (which in the 13. Chap. I call the firſt Orb) <hi>pro Arduis negotis Regis &amp; Regni, &amp; Reipublicae expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diendis,</hi> (which agree <hi>verbatim</hi> (and 'tis obſervable) with the very words of all Writs of Summons to Parliaments) <hi>eidem Cancellario omnino aſſiſtentes &amp; ſecum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuo conſedentes,</hi> (which in a manner In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles them to ſit in the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> with him and many other matters are mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, which I ſhall refer to my <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> becauſe I cannot now warrantably inſert them; but I find in other Books, that anciently they had the care of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:65438:213"/>all Writs of Summons to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments committed to them, which is now (as I have ſhewn) performed by the Clerks of the Pettibag.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As to the Title of <hi>Maiſter,</hi> (from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter,</hi> and from <hi>Magus</hi> a Wiſeman) it is as ancient as moſt of our borrow'd words from the <hi>Latin,</hi> and was ſtill apply'd to Perſons of Knowledge and other Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties above the Degrees of Yeomandry.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the old <hi>Romans</hi> (as may be read in <hi>Livy, Pomponius, Aurelius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) they had twelve great Officers, to whom that Title was given, <hi>viz. Magiſter Populi,</hi> or Dictator, <hi>Magiſter Equitum, Magiſtri Cenſus, Magiſter in Auctionibus, Magiſtri Epiſtolarum, Magiſtri Memoriae, Magiſtri Militum, Magiſter Navis, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtri Officiorum, Magiſtri Scriniorum, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Curiae, Magiſtri Aeris,</hi> and many more of a leſſer Rank; for I ſpeak not of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtri Familiae</hi> or <hi>Privatae,</hi> (or as the word is vulgarly applied to its relative word Servant) but as a Title applied to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Eminency, for their Integrity and Learning; and of theſe there are alſo twelve ſorts with us, (which are found in the Law Books) whereof the firſt we meet with in the Statutes, is the Maſter of the <hi>Mint,</hi> in 2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 14. (2.) the Maſter of the Rolls in the firſt of <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. (for
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:65438:213"/>till then he was call'd Clerk of the Rolls, or <hi>Cuſtos Archivorum,</hi> and chief Clerk of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> (of which there are twelve, as I ſaid, ſince which, ſix chief Clerks, and a greater number of a leſſer Form, are there Conſtituted, whereby they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht from the ancient Clerks, (now the 12. Maſters of <hi>Chancery</hi>) which may be accounted (the Third) ſort in point of time mentioned in the Statutes; (the Fourth,) The Maſter of the Horſe in the firſt of <hi>Edw.</hi> the Sixth; (the Fifth) The Maſter of the Poſtern in 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. (the Sixth) The Maſter of the Kings Houſhold in the 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. (chang'd to the Lord Stuard of the Kings Houſhold, (<hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Brandon</hi> being the firſt of that Title mentioned in any Statute) (the <hi>7th.</hi>) The Maſter of the Court of Wards in the 33 of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. (now of no uſe) (the Eighth) The Maſter of the Muſters, after in the 33 <hi>Eliz.</hi> called Muſter Maſter Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; (the 9.10.11.12.) <hi>viz.</hi> The Maſter of the Armory, the Maſter of the Kings Jewels, the Maſter of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, (and Maſter of the Kings Wardrop) are mentioned in the Statute of 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> not but theſe Officers were before, but the Statutes (as I ſaid) do not take notice of them till the times that they are quoted in the ſaid Statutes.</p>
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:65438:214"/>
               <p n="7">7. Now as the old <hi>Romans</hi> had others which had the Titles of <hi>Magiſtri, viz. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtri <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitatis vel Societatis;</hi> ſo we in imitation, at <hi>Cambridge</hi> have the Title of <hi>Magiſter</hi> fixt at the head of every Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in that Univerſity, (which is an argument of their Antiquity, of which I ſhall ſpeak more) whereas <hi>Oxford</hi> hath but three which bear that Title.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is alſo applied to the Heads of Halls of Companies in <hi>London,</hi> and other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and it hath been formerly applied to all the Members of the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> who were not actually Knights, or Eſquires, or of higher Degrees; but in the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> I do not find it uſed to any, to whom Writs of Summons were ſent to ſit there, except to ſome Priors and Deacons who were ſometimes called <hi>Magiſtri</hi> in their Writs, and others of Religious Orders, call'd alſo in their Writs <hi>Magiſtri,</hi> as alſo to Officers in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, viz.</hi> 49 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Magiſtro Thomae Yong, Officiario Curiae Cancellariae;</hi> but whether it was the ſame Office which is now exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the Maſters of the <hi>Chancery, Non Conſtat;</hi> however they were then under the notion of Clerks in an Eccleſiaſtical ſence; but as Writs were ſent to Clerks or Eccleſiaſticks, with the Title of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter;</hi> ſo in <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourths time, and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65438:214"/>not before, there were Writs ſent to Laicks with that Title, and thoſe were Perſons of high Quality, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 2.3. and 6. <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>4th. Magiſtro Thomae de la Ware,</hi> (ſometimes call'd <hi>Ware</hi> and <hi>Warre</hi>) to attend thoſe Parliaments, and the ſame <hi>Thomas</hi> was alſo Summon'd to the Parliaments of the 1.2.3.4.5.7.8. and and 9. of <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>5th. Magiſtro Tho. de la Ware,</hi> and ſo to the 1.2. and 3. of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Sixth; but in the ſecond Parliament of that year, Mr. <hi>De la Ware</hi> was not Summon'd, but one VVrit was <hi>Magiſtro Johanni Stafford Theſ. Angliae,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther VVrit, <hi>Magiſtro Willielmo Alremith Cuſtod. privati Sigilli.</hi> But in the <hi>4th.</hi> and 6. of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Sixth, both thoſe were left out, and the ſame <hi>Magiſtro Tho. de la Ware</hi> Summond again, and for brevity paſſing to the 36. of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eighth; and then it was expresſly <hi>Roberto Bows Mil.

               <p>HEre I am to ſpeak of ſuch as have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces allowed them in the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> by vertue of Patents only, and firſt of the Clerks; This Title of Clerk from <hi>Cleros,</hi> when the Clergy had (by reaſon of their great learning) the guidance of Civil Offices, was given as an honour to them; and moſt of the great Offices, as the Privy Seal, Maſter of the Rolls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had the Titles of Clerks; but now that Title remains to a lower ſort, of which there are 26. in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who ſtill retain that Title.</p>
               <p>The firſt, (as to the Progreſſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is the Clerk of the Pettibag, which is under the Conduct and within the Patent of the Maſter of the Rolls; (who is the chief of all the Clerks in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> of which Office I have ſpoke in that Section of the Rolls, and in other places.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Clerk of the Crown in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> (call'd <hi>Clericus Coronae in Cancellario,</hi> in his Patent) of whom I have alſo ſpoke curſorily
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:65438:215"/>in ſeveral places) is an Officer to whoſe care many great things are committed, (which may be read in <hi>Compton</hi> and others) but as to what concerns this Subject, I muſt again remind, that all Parliament VVrits which are ſent from the Pettibag, are return'd and kept by the Officer, ſo that the Pettibag gives (as it were) the beginning, this the continuance and ending to a Parliament.</p>
               <p>So as this Clerk of the Crown hath three Capacities. Before the Sitting of a Parliament, to receive returns of VVrits which were iſſued from the Pettibag.</p>
               <p>And in Parliament to take care ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to directions for the iſſuing of Writs in caſe of change or mortality; And in the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> he firſt reads the Titles of all Bills to be preſented to his Majeſty, of which and other parts of his Duty I ſhall ſpeak more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Clerk is term'd in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>Clericus Parliamentorum,</hi> becauſe he is Clerk in all Parliaments during his life; his imployment here being only converſant about the Affairs of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Now in reſpect that all Bills and Matters of State have here their reſult in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> he is the proper Keeper of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, (for the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> is a Court of Record) and to that end his Books are fairly writ, exactly compos'd, according
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:65438:216"/>to the very words and ſence of that Houſe, and conſtantly perus'd by ſome Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that purpoſe, as well for his own juſtification as others ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>He hath alſo an Aſſiſting Clerk allowed him, who is of great uſe and eaſe to him, both of them being well grounded in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, experience and ability, in the ſafe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediting the concerns of that Houſe, which hath both an Ocean of VViſdom, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Rivolets of Honorary punctilios, (not to be omitted by them, ſomewhat different from all other Courts) he hath alſo a Reading Clerk allowed him, who likewiſe attends the Lords Committees; and theſe are all the Clerks which conſtantly attend in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> and are within the Bar.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Of the Clerks of the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> I ſhall ſpeak in the ſecond part.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As I have ſhewn the Imployments of the Clerks of the <hi>Crown Office</hi> in <hi>Chancery,</hi> ſo (to prevent miſapplications) it is fit to ſhew the Imployments alſo of the Clerk of the <hi>Crown Office</hi> in the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> who is no conſtant attendant in this <hi>Houſe</hi> or in the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> but only upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies, and then by Order; but more eſpecially in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> for produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, reading, and managing Records con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning VVrits of Error, <hi>Habeas Corpus, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:65438:216"/>(of which I ſhall ſpeak in order) but his moſt eminent Imployment is upon the Tryal of Peers, as will be ſhewn.</p>
               <p>Of the 26. Clerks before mention'd, (who ſtill retain that Title) theſe five which I have named are the chief which are imployed in Parliamentary Matters; but of the other 21. (which may be ſeen in <hi>Lambert, Fitz Herbert, &amp;c.</hi>) neither the ſix Clerks in <hi>Chancery,</hi> (being Officers of Eminency imployed in that Court bearing that Title, nor are the other Clerks (which are imployed alſo in that Court) in the leaſt (as I know of) ingag'd in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of Parliaments. Note that thoſe five Clerks (whom I firſt mention'd) have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces allotted them within the Bar of either Houſe, as I ſaid.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the Gentleman <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher of the Black Rod.</head>
               <p>THere are but three ways by which the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> do ſend any Meſſage to the <hi>Commons,</hi> of two of them I have ſpoken, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſome of the Judges, or by ſome of the Maſters of <hi>Chancery,</hi>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:65438:217"/>and the King alſo uſes two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> by his Secretaries, or ſome of the Privy-Council, (when they are Members of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi>) both upon ordinary and extraordinary occaſions, or for attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Perſon upon Addreſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when he hath occaſion to Command the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> to attend him in the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> he only ſends this Officer, the manner of which Ceremony I ſhall ſhew in order.</p>
               <p>He is call'd the Black Rod, from the Black Staff or Rod (about three foot long tipt with Silver, and guilt with the Kings Arms at one end, and a Lyon Couchant at the other end, and a guilt Knob in the middle) which he carries in his hand; he is always a Perſon of Quality, and born the Kings Subject; and if not a Knight, is made one upon admiſſion to this Office, and hath his Office by Patent; the firſt Grant of it beginning in <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Before the Sitting of Parliament, he obſerves the Lord Chamberlains directions, in taking care that the <hi>Houſe</hi> be fitted with all things for the Reception of the King, and thoſe who are to ſit there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Imployment alſo is to introduce Lords into that <hi>Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And after that <hi>Houſe</hi> is Sat, he hath Imployments concerning the Commitment of Delinquents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:65438:217"/>
               <p n="4">4. He hath a Seat allowed him, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Bar; and to eaſe him more in theſe and many other Imployments, he hath an Uſher to aſſiſt him, call'd the Yeoman Uſher, alſo Door Keeper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as will be ſhewn.</p>
               <p>And ſo I am come to the laſt Attendant Officer of Note in that <hi>Houſe, viz.</hi> the Kings Serjeant at Arms.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of the Kings Serjeant at Arms, Attendant in the <hi>Houſe of Lords.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Have ſpoken of the <hi>Servientes ad legem</hi> or Serjeants at Law; Now I come to the <hi>Servientes ad arma,</hi> Serjeants at Arms; theſe were ſuch as amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> were call'd <hi>Satellites Caeſaris,</hi> or a Guard to the Emperor, and ſometimes they were call'd <hi>Macerones,</hi> (from whence probably the word Mace might be us'd) which theſe Serjeant at Arms uſe to carry before the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe Serjeants at Arms (for I meddle not with the lower degree in Corporations, ſometimes call'd Serjeants of the Mace, or only Serjeants) there are twenty in number, which are call'd the Kings Serjeants at Arms, and theſe are Created with great Ceremony; for the Perſon who is to be Created kneeling before the King, the King
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:65438:218"/>himſelf lays the Mace on the Serjeants Right Shoulder, and ſays theſe words, <hi>Riſe up Serjeant at Arms, and Eſquire for ever:</hi> He hath his Patent for the Office beſides; (of which and of the particulars of his Imployments, <hi>Segar</hi> in his Book of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity gives a full account) but of theſe twenty the King appropriates ſixteen to his Perſonal Service, whereof four wait on him every Quarter; the other four are thus diſtributed, <hi>viz.</hi> in time of Parliament one is to attend the Speaker of the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> in caſe he is not Lord Chancellor, another to attend the Speaker of the <hi>Houſe of Commons;</hi> one other to attend the Lord Chancellor, and another the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, as well in as out of Parliament.</p>
               <p>But in reſpect the Lord Chancellor and Speaker of the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> is uſually the ſame Perſon, there were but three of the twenty us'd in this time of Parliament, and but two out of Parliament, ſo as the other one or two are reſerv'd for accidental oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
               <p>The Serjeant at Arms who attends the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> hath the privilege of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Mace before the Speaker (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be the Lord Chancellor or not) within the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> up to the very Chair of State, and after he hath made his Obeyſances, he lays it down on the firſt
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:65438:218"/>Woolſack by the Speaker, and ſo departs till the Speaker hath occaſion to uſe him again upon the Riſing of the <hi>Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And herein methinks the Serjeant at Arms of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> hath more reſpect afforded him than the Serjeant at Arms to the <hi>Houſe of Lords;</hi> for the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Serjeant hath the freedom to ſtand at the Bar, and hear all Debates, and when weary of ſtanding, hath an eaſie ſeat by the door; but the Lords Serjeant is not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be in the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi> whilſt it is Sitting, nor hath any Station within the Bar, nor Seat without the Bar, as the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Uſher hath: and yet this Office is more ancient than that, and is not only Serjeant at Arms to the Speaker, and Chancellor (the Parliament not ſitting) but is the chief of the twenty of the Kings Serjeants at Arms; he hath his Duputy, ſo as if there ſhould be occaſion of two, <hi>viz.</hi> for a Speaker and Chancellor, he may ſupply one, and his Deputy the other; and beſides his Deputy he hath alſo other Agents under him, and hath uſe for them; For upon Commitments of Delinquents without door, he is to ſee them forth coming, and in bringing them to the Bar; but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmements or Commitment of any Member within doors, that peculiarly belongs to the Gentleman of the Black Rod.</p>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:65438:219"/>
               <p>So as theſe 2 Officers ſet the firſt wheel of a Parliament in motion; for the Serjeant at Arms conducts the Chancellor or Speaker into the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> the King ſends the Black Rod to the <hi>Commons</hi> to bring up their Speaker, who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the King, goes to his Chair in the <hi>Commons,</hi> uſher'd with the other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants at Arms, and ſo when each Speaker retires from each Houſe, each Serjeant is to each a Conducter.</p>
